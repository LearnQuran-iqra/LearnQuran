# **Āyah 47**

يَا بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ اذْكُرُوا نِعْمَتِيَ الَّتِي أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَأَنِّي فَضَّلْتُكُمْ عَلَى الْعَالَمِينَ

*O Children of Israel, remember My blessing which I bestowed upon you, and that I favored you above all peoples.*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

* **يَا بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ**
  * A direct call, repeated from earlier āyāh (2:40).
  * The repetition shows **urgency** and **continuity**: Allah is reminding them again because they didn’t respond the first time.
  * By addressing them as “Children of Israel” (instead of “Jews” or “People of the Book”), Allah ties them to their noble ancestor Yaʿqūb (Israel), evoking honor and responsibility.
✦ Reflection: Sometimes the Qur’an reminds us of our spiritual lineage to awaken dignity and shame—“If you are truly children of prophets, act like it.”

* **اذْكُرُوا نِعْمَتِيَ** (*remember My blessing*):
  * The word *اذكروا* implies both *recall* and *mention*. It means: don’t just think silently—express gratitude openly.
  * **نعمتي** (My blessing):
  * Singular form, though the blessings were countless. This singularity suggests that *all blessings flow as one stream from Allah*, and forgetting even one is like forgetting them all.
✦ Reflection: Gratitude is not selective—you cannot thank Allah for one favor while ignoring the others.

* **الَّتِي أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ**
  * The verb *أنعمتُ* (I bestowed) uses the **first person singular** with emphasis. Allah Himself gave—no one else shares credit.
  * This also reminds them: divine favor is *personal and direct*, not just historical.

* **وَأَنِّي فَضَّلْتُكُمْ عَلَى الْعَالَمِينَ**
  * *فَضَّلْتُكُمْ* (I favored you):
  * From the root **ف-ض-ل**, meaning to prefer, to give an advantage.
  * This favor was **conditional and temporal**—for their era, not forever. Later nations (especially the Ummah of the beloved Prophet Muhammad ﷺ) received greater favor.
  * *على العالمين* (above all peoples):
  * Not an absolute superiority, but a contextual one—they were given prophets, scripture, miracles, and leadership in their time.
✦ Reflection: Divine favor is a responsibility, not a permanent badge. If misused, it can be taken away.

**✦ Reflections**
* The āyah mixes **honor** (“I favored you”) with **reminder of responsibility** (“remember My blessing”).
* It is both soft (reminding blessings) and firm (hinting: “do not betray this favor”).
* Honor and blessings are meaningless without gratitude and obedience. Being chosen was not a privilege to boast about—it was a test of faithfulness.

# **Āyah 48**

وَاتَّقُوا يَوْمًا لَا تَجْزِي نَفْسٌ عَنْ نَّفْسٍ شَيْئًا وَلَا يُقْبَلُ مِنْهَا شَفَاعَةٌ وَلَا يُؤْخَذُ مِنْهَا عَدْلٌ وَلَا هُمْ يُنصَرُونَ

*And fear a Day when no soul will benefit another at all, nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will compensation be taken from it, nor will they be helped.*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

* **وَاتَّقُوا (And fear / be conscious of):**
  * Command form of *ittaqū* from **taqwā**, meaning *to guard oneself, to have consciousness of Allah*.
  * The use here signals **urgent personal responsibility**—they cannot rely on lineage, scripture, or social status.

* **يَوْمًا (a Day):**
  * Definite future moment: *Yawm al-Qiyāmah*, the Day of Resurrection.
  * Singular form emphasizes the **inevitability and singularity** of ultimate accountability.

* **لَا تَجْزِي نَفْسٌ عَنْ نَّفْسٍ شَيْئًا (no soul will benefit another at all):**
  * **تَجْزِي** (will suffice) stresses the **absolute inability of anyone to save another**.
  * The repetition of *nafs* (soul) emphasizes **personal accountability**—you cannot outsource responsibility.

* **وَلَا يُقْبَلُ مِنْهَا شَفَاعَةٌ (nor will intercession be accepted from it):**
  * Intercession (*shafā‘ah*) here refers to even those who try to plead on someone’s behalf.
  * The phrasing emphasizes that **no mediator can override justice** except by Allah’s will.

* **وَلَا يُؤْخَذُ مِنْهَا عَدْلٌ (nor will compensation be taken from it):**
  * *ʿAdl* (compensation, ransom) cannot be offered. Any worldly system of justice fails in the hereafter.

* **وَلَا هُمْ يُنصَرُونَ (nor will they be helped):**
  * Final reinforcement: **no external aid, no rescue**. Even collective support cannot protect an individual.

**✦ Reflections**
* This āyah presents a **stark contrast** with the previous one (47), where Allah reminded them of past blessings. Now the focus is **inevitable accountability**.
* Rhetorical effect: repetition of negatives (*lā tajzī, wa lā yuqbal, wa lā yu’khadh, wa lā yunsarūn*) builds **urgency and inescapability**.
* Emotionally, it creates a sense of **seriousness and gravity**, preparing hearts to understand why obedience, humility, and worship (as in previous āyāt 45–46) are essential.
* Personal accountability is central: no external source of salvation, no excuses, no worldly leverage—*every soul stands alone before Allah*.

 **Āyah 49** — Allah recounts the deliverance of the Children of Israel from Pharaoh, tying accountability to historical lessons
 
# **Āyah 49**

وَإِذْ نَجَّيْنَاكُم مِّنْ آلِ فِرْعَوْنَ يَسُومُونَكُمْ سُوءَ الْعَذَابِ يُذَبِّحُونَ أَبْنَاءَكُمْ وَيَسْتَحْيُونَ نِسَاءَكُمْ وَفِي ذَلِكُمْ فِتْنَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ عَظِيمٌ

* **نَجَّيْنَاكُم (We saved you):**

* **مِّنْ آلِ فِرْعَوْنَ (from the people of Pharaoh):**
  * “Āl Fir‘awn” specifies the tyrannical regime. The mention invokes **fear and awe**, reminding them of oppression they endured.

* **يُذَبِّحُونَ أَبْنَاءَكُمْ وَيَسْتَحْيُونَ نِسَاءَكُمْ**
  * *Yudhabbihūn abnā’akum*: systematic killing of male children to suppress lineage.
  * *Yastahyūn nisā’akum*: sparing women, perhaps to enslave them.
  * The contrast stresses **inhumanity and cruelty**, evoking empathy and moral urgency.

* **وَفِي ذَلِكُمْ فِتْنَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ عَظِيمٌ**
  * *Fitnah* = trial, test, or severe affliction.
  * The phrase emphasizes that such historical suffering **is both punishment for wrongdoing and a test of patience, faith, and obedience**.
  * *ʿAẓīm* (great) intensifies the magnitude of the trial, reminding them of Allah’s power and wisdom.

* The narrative links **accountability, patience, and trust**. Even under extreme oppression, salvation comes through Allah’s guidance and command.
* The juxtaposition of cruelty and divine trial teaches that hardship tests **faith, gratitude, and humility**.

# **Āyah 50**

وَإِذْ فَرَقْنَا بِكُمُ الْبَحْرَ فَأَنْقَذْنَاكُمْ وَأَغْرَقْنَا آلَ فِرْعَوْنَ وَأَنْتُمْ تَنْظُرُونَ

**✦ Reflections**
* The āyah reinforces the **theme of divine rescue paired with justice**. Deliverance does not happen without prior oppression; punishment of oppressors is a necessary demonstration of divine authority.
* Witnessing the miracle reinforces **faith through evidence**, not blind belief.
* The Qur’an carefully structures the story: torment (49) → deliverance (50), showing both **trial and triumph**, reminding Banī Isrā’īl (and all believers) that obedience and trust in Allah lead to salvation.

  * Continues the historical recollection motif (*wa-idh*), connecting past blessings and deliverance to moral lessons.
