# **Āyah 8**

وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَقُولُ آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَبِالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ وَمَا هُم بِمُؤْمِنِينَ

*And of the people are some who say, “We believe in Allah and the Last Day,” but they are not 'true' believers.*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

* **وَمِنَ النَّاسِ**

  * “And of the people” — introduces a category among humans.
  * Sets up contrast: not all who claim faith are true believers.
  * The particle **مِنَ** signals a subset, implying selective behaviour.

* **مَن يَقُولُ**

  * “Those who say” — emphasis on speech rather than inner reality.
  * The present tense **يَقُولُ** indicates ongoing or habitual speech, a pattern, not a one-time utterance.

* **آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَبِالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ**

  * “We believe in Allah and the Last Day” — the content of their claim.
  * The double object (**بِاللَّهِ وَبِالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ**) highlights essential pillars of faith: Allah and accountability.
  * Their words mimic true belief, creating a deceptive appearance.

* **وَمَا هُم بِمُؤْمِنِينَ**

  * “But they are not believers” — the contrast is sharp: claim vs. reality.
  * **مُؤْمِنِينَ** (from آمن) — emphasizes inner conviction and submission, not mere verbal affirmation.
  * The negation **وَمَا** highlights absolute absence of faith; they are categorically not believers.

**✦ Reflections**
- This ayah introduces the **theme of hypocrisy (nifaq)**. The Qur’ān distinguishes between outward declarations and inward reality. Speech alone does not define belief; true faith requires inner conviction.
- The structure of the Ayah sets up a **contrastive pattern** that continues in subsequent ayat: claim → exposure → consequences. By emphasizing both **Allah** and the **Last Day**, the Qur’ān points to the core areas where hypocrites fail—they acknowledge God and accountability in words, but their hearts are absent.

# **Āyah 9**

يُخَادِعُونَ اللَّهَ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَمَا يَخْدَعُونَ إِلَّا أَنفُسَهُمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ

*They \[hypocrites] try to deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive none except themselves, and they do not perceive it.*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

* **يُخَادِعُونَ**

  * “They try to deceive” — from خَدَعَ, meaning to cheat, mislead, or trick.
  * Present tense **يُخَادِعُونَ** signals habitual or ongoing action, reflecting the hypocrites’ continuous duplicity.

* **اللَّهَ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا**

  * “Allah and those who believe” — two targets of their deceit: the Divine and the sincere believers.
  * The pairing shows the gravity: deception is both spiritual (against Allah) and social (against fellow humans).

* **وَمَا يَخْدَعُونَ إِلَّا أَنفُسَهُمْ**

  * “But they deceive none except themselves” — Allah exposes the futility of their action.
  * The structure **إِلَّا أَنفُسَهُمْ** emphasizes exclusivity: their scheme harms only them, not others.
  * Highlights the **divine justice**: attempts to manipulate reality cannot escape Allah’s knowledge.

* **وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ**

  * “And they do not perceive it” — **يشعرون** implies subtle, almost sensory awareness; they are blind to the spiritual consequences.
  * The present tense shows their unawareness is continuous, not temporary.

**✦ Reflections**
- This Ayah unveils the **self-defeating nature of hypocrisy**. The hypocrites believe they are tricking others and evading divine notice, but in reality, **they are the only ones deceived**.
- The Qur’ān emphasizes their **blindness and self-delusion**: they cannot sense the consequences of their actions. This builds on Ayah 8, where their verbal faith contrasted with inner disbelief; now, their actions are shown to be **futile and spiritually harmful to themselves**.
- The progression is clear:
	1. They **claim faith** (Ayah 8).
	2. They **try to deceive others** but ultimately deceive only themselves (Ayah 9).

# **Āyah 10**

فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ فَزَادَهُمُ اللَّهُ مَرَضًا وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْذِبُونَ

*In their hearts is a disease, and Allah has increased their disease; and for them is a painful punishment because they used to lie.*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

* **فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ**

  * “In their hearts is a disease” — **مرض** literally means illness, but metaphorically denotes **spiritual corruption or moral sickness**.
  * **قلوبهم** (their hearts) pinpoints the **seat of perception and moral awareness**, showing the internal nature of hypocrisy.

* **فَزَادَهُمُ اللَّهُ مَرَضًا**

  * “And Allah has increased their disease” — **فَ** indicates causal or consequential progression.
  * The doubling of **مرض** emphasizes intensification: their hidden spiritual sickness grows because of their persistent hypocrisy.
  * This reflects the **Qur’anic principle**: persistence in wrongdoing reinforces moral blindness.

* **وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ**

  * “And for them is a painful punishment” — **أليم** conveys sharp, excruciating pain, both physically and spiritually.
  * **لهُم** (for them) asserts inevitability; punishment is directly linked to their internal state.

* **بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْذِبُونَ**

  * “Because they used to lie” — the reason is their habitual lying, both in speech (claiming faith) and in action (deceiving others).
  * The imperfect tense **يَكْذِبُونَ** underscores continuous behavior.

**✦ Reflections**
This Ayah depicts the **psychological and spiritual consequences of hypocrisy**:
* The metaphor of a **heart disease** conveys that the hypocrites’ corruption is **internal, hidden, and insidious**, not just superficial.
* Allah’s response — **increasing the disease** — illustrates that spiritual blindness is self-reinforcing when one persists in deceit.
* The Ayah links **internal corruption** directly to **external consequences**: the hypocrite’s lies lead to inevitable **painful punishment**, demonstrating the Qur’anic balance between inner reality and divine justice.

The progression from Ayah 8–10 is striking:
1. Claiming faith outwardly (Ayah 8).
2. Deception that harms only themselves (Ayah 9).
3. Spiritual sickness in the heart, which grows, leading to punishment (Ayah 10).

# **Āyah 11**

وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ لَا تُفْسِدُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ قَالُوا إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُصْلِحُونَ

*And when it is said to them, “Do not cause corruption on the earth,” they say, “We are only reformers.”*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

* **وَإِذَا**

  * “And when” — introduces a recurring situation, a habitual reaction of the hypocrites.
  * Connects this ayah to the previous ones, showing a pattern of behavior.

* **قِيلَ لَهُمْ**

  * “It is said to them” — passive, highlighting that the command comes from Allah or His Messenger, yet they respond with defiance.

* **لَا تُفْسِدُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ**

  * “Do not cause corruption on the earth” — **فساد** refers to moral, social, and spiritual corruption.
  * The use of **في الأرض** stresses the worldly scope of their mischief — it affects society, not just themselves.

* **قَالُوا إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُصْلِحُونَ**

  * “They say, ‘We are only reformers’” — their response is **self-aggrandizing**.
  * **إنما** (only/merely) is used to assert exclusivity, portraying themselves as the sole source of goodness.
  * **مصلحون** — reformers, literally “those who restore or improve,” shows a **deliberate inversion** of reality: they present corruption as reform.

**✦ Reflections**
This ayah exposes the **arrogance and hypocrisy of their speech**.
* They are **directly warned** against spreading corruption, yet respond with **self-righteous justification**.
* The Qur’ān highlights the **contrast between their words and reality**: they claim reform, but their actions are corruptive.
* This sets up the next Ayah (Ayah 12), where Allah delivers the **decisive judgment**: they are in fact the corrupters, though they do not perceive it.

The structure is deliberate: the hypocrites **claim virtue**, Allah **exposes the truth**, and their **blindness and self-deception** are emphasized.

---

# **Āyah 12**

أَلَا إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ الْمُفْسِدُونَ وَلَـٰكِن لَّا يَشْعُرُونَ

*Unquestionably, it is they who are the corrupters, but they do not perceive.*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

* **أَلَا**

  * A compound particle: **أَ** (for drawing attention) + **لَا** (negation), functioning here as a **rhetorical alert**: “Behold! Pay attention! Without doubt!”
  * Placed at the start to give the statement the force of a **public declaration**.

* **إِنَّهُمْ**

  * **إِنَّ** — emphatic particle reinforcing certainty.
  * **هُمْ** — pronoun emphasizing identity: “They, and no one else.”

* **هُمُ الْمُفْسِدُونَ**

  * **المفسدون** — definite noun, “the corrupters.”
  * Nominal sentence with pronoun + definite predicate, **locking the identity to the act**: they are the source of corruption.

* **وَلَـٰكِن**

  * “But” — introduces the tragic irony that follows.

* **لَّا يَشْعُرُونَ**

  * **يشعرون** — from **شعر**, meaning to sense or perceive.
  * Negation **لَا** indicates **spiritual or moral blindness**, not mere ignorance.
  * Present tense implies **continuous unawareness**.

**✦ Reflections**
This Ayah delivers the **divine counter-judgment** to the hypocrites’ claim of being reformers (Ayah 11):
* The emphatic structure **أَلَا إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ** acts like a **divine gavel**, leaving no doubt.
* Bitter irony: they think themselves saviours, yet they are blind to the destruction they cause.
* The shift from **مصلحون** (claim) to **مفسدون** (reality) captures the **moral inversion of hypocrisy**

# **Āyah 13**

وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ آمِنُوا كَمَا آمَنَ النَّاسُ قَالُوا أَنُؤْمِنُ كَمَا آمَنَ السُّفَهَاءُ أَلَا إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ السُّفَهَاءُ وَلَـٰكِن لَّا يَعْلَمُونَ

*And when it is said to them, “Believe as the people have believed,” they say, “Shall we believe as the fools have believed?” Unquestionably, it is they who are the fools, but they do not know.*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

* **وَإِذَا**

  * “And when” — introduces a recurring scenario, emphasizing habitual reaction of the hypocrites.

* **قِيلَ لَهُمْ**

  * “It is said to them” — passive, indicating instruction comes from Allah or His Messenger; emphasizes their lack of awareness or acceptance.

* **آمِنُوا كَمَا آمَنَ النَّاسُ**

  * “Believe as the people have believed” — presents the **standard of sincere faith**.
  * **كَمَا** (just as) stresses **faith follows the example of the sincere**, not arbitrary choice.

* **قَالُوا أَنُؤْمِنُ كَمَا آمَنَ السُّفَهَاءُ**

  * “They said, ‘Shall we believe as the fools have believed?’”
  * **السُّفَهَاءُ** — literally “the fools,” denoting **moral and spiritual immaturity**, not mere intellectual deficiency.
  * Their sarcastic response reflects arrogance and self-importance.

* **أَلَا إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ السُّفَهَاءُ**

  * “Unquestionably, it is they who are the fools” — Allah overturns their self-judgment.
  * **أَلَا إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ** — emphatic structure, reinforcing certainty and divine authority.

* **وَلَـٰكِن لَّا يَعْلَمُونَ**

  * “But they do not know” — **يَعْلَمُونَ** (from علم) refers to **cognitive and spiritual blindness**.
  * Present tense emphasizes ongoing unawareness.

**✦ Reflections**
* This ayah exposes **arrogance and self-delusion**: hypocrites mock sincere believers, calling them fools, yet they themselves are spiritually foolish.
* The contrast between **their sarcastic speech** and **Allah’s judgment** shows the **inversion of perception** in hypocrisy.
* The sequence from Ayah 12 to 13 builds a **layered portrait of hypocrisy**:
	  1. They claim reform (Ayah 11).
	  2. Allah declares them the corrupters (Ayah 12).
	  3. They mock sincere believers, yet Allah exposes them as the fools (Ayah 13).

# **Āyah 14**

وَإِذَا لَقُوا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا قَالُوا آمَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلَوْا إِلَىٰ شَيَاطِينِهِمْ قَالُوا إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُسْتَهْزِئُونَ

*And when they meet those who believe, they say, “We believe,” but when they are alone with their devils, they say, “Indeed, we are with you; we were only mocking.”*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

* **وَإِذَا لَقُوا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا**

  * “And when they meet those who believe” — **لقوا** (meet) implies social interaction; the hypocrites present a false front.
  * Highlights the **dual nature of their behavior**: outward conformity versus inner deceit.

* **قَالُوا آمَنَّا**

  * “They say, ‘We believe’” — verbal affirmation without inner conviction; their speech is **performative, not sincere**.

* **وَإِذَا خَلَوْا إِلَىٰ شَيَاطِينِهِمْ**

  * “And when they are alone with their devils” — **خلوا** (alone) indicates privacy; **شياطينهم** refers to companions or influences aligned with mischief.
  * Marks the **contrast between public and private behavior**.

* **قَالُوا إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ**

  * “They say, ‘Indeed, we are with you’” — an **affirmation of alliance** with wrongdoing in private.

* **إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُسْتَهْزِئُونَ**

  * “We were only mocking” — **إنما** (only) emphasizes the claim of jest; **مستهلئون** indicates deliberate **mockery** or derision.
  * Exposes their **arrogant, insincere duplicity**: outward faith, inward mockery.

**✦ Reflections**
* This ayah reveals the **full duality of hypocrisy**: public pretension versus private alliance with corruption.
* The hypocrites’ mockery shows **arrogance, deceit, and moral blindness**, confirming what was stated in Ayah 12–13.
* The Qur’ān emphasizes that their **duplicity is conscious**, not accidental — they deliberately deceive believers while mocking the truth privately.
* The progression is striking: verbal claims (Ayah 8), attempted deception (Ayah 9), heart disease (Ayah 10), false reform (Ayah 11), exposed corruption (Ayah 12), self-delusion (Ayah 13), and finally **mockery in secret** (Ayah 14).

#### Let’s examine **شَيَاطِينِهِم** in **خَلَوْا إِلَىٰ شَيَاطِينِهِم** more deeply:

**Word Analysis: شَيَاطِينِهِم**

***Root and Form**
  * Root: **ش-ي-ط-ن** — conveys the idea of **rebellion, misguidance, or deviation from the right path**.
  * Form: **شياطين** is the plural of **شيطان**, literally “a rebellious one” or “an adversary.”
  * The possessive suffix **ـهم** indicates **“their devils”**, meaning those whom they align with privately — influences, companions, or forces that encourage wrongdoing.

***Semantic Range**
  * **Primary meaning:** Evil or rebellious beings, including both literal devils and metaphorical agents of misguidance.
  * **Extended meaning in context:** Could refer to **their cohorts of corruption**, those with whom they plot, joke, or indulge in mockery against the truth.
  * Qur’anic usage often blends **external forces** (jinn, devils) and **human collaborators** in evil, making the term versatile and morally weighty.

***Rhetorical and Emotional Effect**
  * **Contrast:** Public behavior with believers versus private alignment with shayateen heightens the **duplicity** and **moral blindness** of hypocrites.
  * **Psychological impact:** It conveys that hypocrisy is not isolated; it thrives in **secretive alliances** with misguidance.
  * **Metaphoric layer:** The hypocrite is “in company with devils,” implying their **inner orientation is toward corruption**, not truth.

***Why this word is chosen**
  * Instead of a neutral term like “friends” or “companions,” **شياطِين** signals **active opposition to divine guidance**.
  * It gives **moral and spiritual weight**: they are not just misled; they **choose alignment with forces of misguidance**, highlighting the severity of hypocrisy.

✦ **Reflections**
The phrase **خَلَوْا إِلَىٰ شَيَاطِينِهِم** depicts the hypocrites’ **dual life**: outwardly conforming, inwardly siding with rebellion. The word **شياطِين** is precise: it captures **both the spiritual reality and the social dimension** of their misguidance, emphasizing that hypocrisy is **not private ignorance but a deliberate, morally corrupt alliance**.

#### Let’s explore how the Qur’ān differentiates between **literal devils (jinn) and human “shayateen” companions**

##### **1. Literal Shayatin (Devils/Jinn)**
 ***Definition:**
  * Created beings from smokeless fire (**Qur’ān 55:15**).
  * Naturally inclined to disobey Allah unless they choose otherwise (Iblīs is the prime example).
  * Influence humans subtly, whispering evil suggestions (**waswās**, Qur’ān 114:4–5).
***Contextual cues in Qur’ān:**
  * Phrases like **“إِلَى الشَّيَاطِين”** without possessive suffix usually refer to literal devils.
  * Often connected to **temptation, whispering, and spiritual trial**.

##### **2. Human Shayateen (Companions of Corruption)**
***Definition:**
  * Humans who actively conspire, mock, or promote wrongdoing.
  * Can be hypocrites, collaborators, or morally corrupt groups.
***Contextual cues:**
  * In **Al-Baqarah 2:14**, **شياطِينِهِم** literally means “their devils,” but the possessive suffix **ـهم** points to **human alignment**: these are people they knowingly side with in mischief.
  * The behavior described — mockery, secretive alliance, sarcastic speech — is distinctly **human**, not supernatural.
***Purpose in Qur’ān:**
  * To show **moral and spiritual orientation**, not just literal possession or influence.
  * Highlights hypocrisy: outward conformity to truth, inward alignment with misguidance.

##### **3. Blending Human and Literal Shayateen**
The Qur’ān often uses the term **شياطين** for **both literal devils and morally corrupt humans**, creating a **layered moral meaning**:
  1. Literal: devils whisper evil, tempt, and mislead.
  2. Human: hypocrites and corrupt companions act as active “devils” in society.
This duality **amplifies the psychological and spiritual warning**: hypocrisy isn’t merely ignorance; it’s deliberate moral alliance with corruption, whether spiritual or social.

✦ **Reflections**
In **Al-Baqarah 2:14**, the word **شياطِينِهِم** signals **both the moral reality and social dynamics** of hypocrisy:
* Publicly, they align with believers.
* Privately, they side with those who oppose truth — human “shayateen” — reflecting deliberate spiritual rebellion.
* The Qur’ān’s choice of **شياطِين** over neutral words emphasizes **intentionality, opposition, and corruption**, making hypocrisy **a serious moral disease**.

# **Āyah 15**

اللَّهُ يَسْتَهْزِئُ بِهِمْ وَيَمُدُّهُمْ فِي طُغْيَانِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ

*Allah throws their mockery back at them and prolongs them in their transgression, wandering blindly.*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

* **اللَّهُ**

  * Subject of the sentence — highlights that **all divine action is deliberate**, not random.

* **يَسْتَهْزِئُ بِهِمْ**

  * Indicates that their **deception and self-delusion have made them objects of divine irony**.
  * Not mocking in a trivial sense, but showing the **consequences of their own hypocrisy**.

* **وَيَمُدُّهُمْ فِي طُغْيَانِهِمْ**

  * “And prolongs them in their transgression” — **يمددهم** (extend) implies a **temporal continuation**.
  * **طغيانهم** — rebellion, overstepping moral bounds, defiance of divine guidance.
  * Divine “extension” here allows them to **experience the fruits of their own choices**, highlighting responsibility.

* **يَعْمَهُونَ**

  * “Wandering blindly” — from **عمى** root, implying **moral and spiritual blindness**, not just ignorance.
  * Present tense indicates **ongoing, habitual state**; they continue without perceiving the reality of their corruption.

**✦ Reflections**
* This ayah shows the **consequence of hypocrisy and alignment with shayateen** (Ayah 14).
* The phrase **يمددهم في طغيانهم يعمهون** depicts a **self-perpetuating cycle**: their rebellion grows, their blindness persists, and they continue **wandering spiritually**.
* There’s a strong psychological insight: those who mock truth in secret and align with corruption **trap themselves in moral darkness**, even as they think they control the situation.

# **Āyah 16**

أُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱشْتَرَوُا۟ ٱلضَّلَـٰلَةَ بِٱلْهُدَىٰ فَمَا رَبِحَت تِّجَـٰرَتُهُمْ وَمَا كَانُوا۟ مُهْتَدِينَ

*They are the ones who purchased error in exchange for guidance, so their trade did not profit, and they were never guided.*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

* **أُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ**

  * A demonstrative pronoun pointing to them **with distance** (“those ones”), marking **disdain and detachment**.
  * It separates them from the community of believers, as if to say: *they are far removed*.

* **ٱلَّذِينَ ٱشْتَرَوُا۟ ٱلضَّلَـٰلَةَ بِٱلْهُدَىٰ**

  * **اشتروا** — literally “purchased / bartered.”
  * A powerful **commercial metaphor**: they **traded guidance** (a priceless divine gift) for **misguidance** (worthless loss).
  * **بالهدى** — “with guidance” as the currency they spent. They *had access to light*, yet exchanged it willingly.
  * **الضلالة** — definite form (with “ال”) makes it the **embodiment of misguidance**, not just a minor slip.

* **فَمَا رَبِحَت تِّجَـٰرَتُهُمْ**

  * “So their trade did not profit.”
  * **ربحت** — to gain, profit.
  * Their bargain is portrayed like a failed business: they invested in falsehood, expecting returns, but the deal collapsed.
  * Qur’ān **mirrors their self-deception**: they thought themselves clever traders, but in reality, they bankrupted themselves.

* **وَمَا كَانُوا۟ مُهْتَدِينَ**

  * Double negation: not guided, and never were guided.
  * Not a temporary loss — their very **identity is estrangement from guidance**.
  * The shift from a business metaphor to a direct divine verdict seals their fate: *not only did they fail in profit, they were never truly on the right path to begin with*.

**✦ Reflections**
* The Qur’an here uses **economic imagery** that Arabs deeply understood: markets, trade, profit. Hypocrites are described as **foolish traders** who thought they made a deal but actually **sold away their soul’s capital**.
* There’s deep irony: they believed they were outsmarting believers (Ayah 9–14), but in reality, they **outsmarted themselves** — turning guidance into loss.
* The Ayah combines **distance (أولئك)**, **metaphor (trade)**, and **final judgment (وما كانوا مهتدين)** in one rhythm, producing a tone of **finality and exposure**.
* ✦ Spiritually: every choice we make is a kind of “trade” — we’re either investing in guidance or in misguidance. Hypocrites squander what could have been eternal profit.

# **Āyah 17**

مَثَلُهُمْ كَمَثَلِ ٱلَّذِى ٱسْتَوْقَدَ نَارًۭا فَلَمَّآ أَضَآءَتْ مَا حَوْلَهُۥ ذَهَبَ ٱللَّهُ بِنُورِهِمْ وَتَرَكَهُمْ فِى ظُلُمَـٰتٍۢ لَّا يُبْصِرُونَ

*Their example is like that of one who kindled a fire; then, when it illuminated what was around him, Allah took away their light and left them in darknesses, unable to see.*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

* **مَثَلُهُمْ**

  * “Their example / likeness.”
  * The Qur’an shifts to **parable imagery** — not just to describe, but to let us **see hypocrisy in action**.
  * By saying *their likeness*, Allah signals their reality is better grasped through imagery than direct description.

* **كَمَثَلِ ٱلَّذِى ٱسْتَوْقَدَ نَارًۭا**

  * **استوقد** — not just “lit a fire” but “labored to ignite it, sought to kindle.”
  * Suggests **effort and intention**: the hypocrites *sought* guidance, pretended to want light.
  * **نارًا** — fire: both **source of light and warmth** — a symbol of truth and faith.

* **فَلَمَّآ أَضَآءَتْ مَا حَوْلَهُۥ**

  * **أضاءت** — “it illuminated.”
  * The light benefited *the surroundings* but not necessarily the person.
  * They enjoyed **the social and worldly benefits of being among Muslims** (security, honor, belonging) without internalizing the faith.

* **ذَهَبَ ٱللَّهُ بِنُورِهِمْ**

  * Notice: *with their light* — not with the fire itself.
  * Subtle distinction: The **source (nār)** remains, but their **share of light (nūr)** is stripped.
  * Balāghah: fire can burn without benefiting — likewise, guidance was present, but hypocrites lost the benefit.

* **وَتَرَكَهُمْ فِى ظُلُمَـٰتٍۢ**

  * **ظلمات** — plural: layers of darkness (doubt, disbelief, hypocrisy).
  * No singular “darkness” — but compounded, suffocating blindness.

* **لَّا يُبْصِرُونَ**

  * Present tense: they are *constantly unable to see*.
  * It’s not a one-time event — but their **permanent spiritual state**.

**✦ Reflections**
* The parable shows hypocrisy as a **temporary illusion**: like fire, it flickers, gives momentary brightness, then vanishes, leaving deeper darkness.
* This reflects their **false conversion**: when Islam seemed beneficial, they joined; when trials came, the light was taken away.
* **Contrast between نار (fire) and نور (light):** fire is physical, can harm; light is subtle, beneficial. They lose the “nūr” (the divine truth), though the “nār” (trial, exposure, burning consequence) remains.
* The plural **ظلمات** paints hypocrisy not as one error, but as a whole **network of confusions and veils**.

#### Let’s open Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī’s lens here. In **al-Tafsīr al-Kabīr** on *Al-Baqarah 2:17* (the parable of the fire)

##### **1. Why “nūr” instead of “nār”?**
Rāzī notes that the hypocrites kindled *nār* (fire), but Allah says *ذَهَبَ ٱللَّهُ بِنُورِهِمْ* (He took away their light). Why this shift?
* If the fire itself was extinguished, they would feel both heat and light gone. But the Qur’ān mentions only **light** being removed.
* This indicates that the **fire (Islam’s outward appearance, rituals, community protection)** remains. Hypocrites still stand in prayer, sit with believers, even enjoy worldly safety under Islam’s shade.
* What is gone is the **nūr** — the **benefit of faith**: guidance, certainty, peace of the heart.

Rāzī says this is a **subtle Qur’ānic choice**: it preserves the irony that they “still have fire” (the shell of religion) but no “light” (its reality).

##### **2. Light as a metaphor for īmān**
* *Nūr* is not physical sight here, but the **inner perception of the heart**.
* Rāzī explains that **guidance is always described as nūr** in Qur’ān (e.g. *اللَّهُ نُورُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ*).
* So when Allah says “their nūr was taken,” it means: **their faith was snatched after they saw its truth**, leaving them in spiritual blindness.

##### **3. Why “their light” (بِنُورِهِمْ), not “the light” (بِالنُّور)?**
Rāzī emphasizes this precision:
* “Their light” = each hypocrite had a personal *chance* at guidance. Allah gave them exposure, even a taste of īmān.
* But when they chose hypocrisy, Allah stripped **their personal share of light**, while the universal light of Islam remains shining for others.

##### **4. The rhetorical impact**
Rāzī says the parable cuts in two stages:
1. **They lit a fire** — a deliberate act, like entering Islam outwardly.
2. **Allah took their light** — showing their hypocrisy was punished by losing the very thing they pretended to have.

It’s like saying: they kindled the torch of religion, but Allah blew out the flame in *their own lanterns*, leaving them to stumble in pitch darkness.

✦ **In sum, according to Imam Rāzī:**
* The **fire = Islam’s external shell**.
* The **light = īmān’s inner truth**.
* The hypocrites are left with fire (rituals, appearances) but no light (guidance).
* Their blindness is not of the eyes, but of the **hearts that once glimpsed the light but lost it**.

# **Āyah 18**

صُمٌّۢ بُكْمٌ عُمْىٌ فَهُمْ لَا يَرْجِعُونَ

*Deaf, dumb, blind – so they will not return.*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

**1. صُمٌّ (ṣummun – Deaf)**

* Plural of *aṣamm* (أصمّ).
* Not literal deafness — they hear sounds, but they refuse to hear guidance.
* The Qur’ān uses the metaphor of deafness for **stubborn rejection of truth**, as if divine words never enter their hearts.
* Morphologically, the word is intensive — not just casually deaf, but **completely sealed off** from hearing.

**2. بُكْمٌ (bukmun – Dumb / Mute)**

* Plural of *abkam* (أبكم).
* They cannot (or will not) speak the truth.
* Their tongues are tied when it comes to declaring faith sincerely, though they use them freely for hypocrisy.
* Rāzī highlights: muteness here is **moral incapacity** — they are unable to speak anything beneficial for their souls.

**3. عُمْيٌ (ʿumyun – Blind)**

* Plural of *aʿmā* (أعمى).
* They can see the world, but not the signs of Allah.
* Again, metaphorical blindness — **spiritual blindness of the heart**.
* Notice the order: deafness (no hearing), muteness (no speaking), blindness (no seeing) — covering **all three avenues of guidance**: listening to truth, professing it, and perceiving it.

**4. فَهُمْ لَا يَرْجِعُونَ (so they do not return)**

* *La yarjiʿūn* is present tense: their refusal is **ongoing and continuous**.
* “Return” here means **to guidance, to repentance, to the truth** they abandoned.
* The use of *fa-* ties their sensory paralysis to the consequence: because they are spiritually deaf, dumb, and blind, **return becomes impossible**.
##### **Rhetorical Force**
* The āyah is extremely compact: just three words of affliction, one word of consequence.
* Each word is in the plural, emphasizing the **collective pathology** of hypocrisy.
* The rhythm — *ṣummun bukmun ʿumyun* — is sharp and heavy, like hammer blows.
* By dropping verbs (no “they are”), the Qur’ān paints them as **frozen identities**: they are nothing but deaf, dumb, blind.

✦ **Reflections**
* The Qur’ān strips the hypocrites of their faculties — not physically, but morally.
* Guidance enters through hearing (listening to Qur’ān), affirmation comes through the tongue, and conviction through vision (seeing signs). Hypocrites block all three, making return nearly impossible.
* The terrifying warning: when arrogance shuts every gateway of truth, even the **chance to return** fades away.

# **Āyah 19**

أَوْ كَصَيِّبٍۢ مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ فِيهِ ظُلُمَـٰتٌۭ وَرَعْدٌۭ وَبَرْقٌۭ ۖ يَجْعَلُونَ أَصَـٰبِعَهُمْ فِىٓ ءَاذَانِهِم مِّنَ الصَّوَٰعِقِ حَذَرَ ٱلْمَوْتِ ۚ وَٱللَّهُ مُحِيطٌۢ بِٱلْكَـٰفِرِينَ

*Or like a rainstorm from the sky, within it are darknesses, thunder, and lightning. They place their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps, fearing death. But Allah encompasses the disbelievers.*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

**1. أَوْ (aw – Or)**

* Continuation from the previous parable (fire).
* Offers an *alternative image* — not contradiction, but another layer of their condition.
* Shows hypocrisy is not one-dimensional: sometimes like fire (light lost), sometimes like storm (fear and panic).

**2. كَصَيِّبٍ (ka-ṣayyibin – like a rainstorm)**

* *Ṣayyib* from root ص و ب, meaning “to pour down.”
* It indicates **heavy rain pouring with force**, not just drizzle.
* Symbolism: the Qur’ān’s revelation — life-giving like rain, yet terrifying for those unprepared.

**3. مِّنَ السَّمَاءِ (from the sky)**

* Reminds that this storm is **from above**, beyond human control.
* Revelation, destiny, and divine decree descend from the sky — overwhelming man.

**4. فِيهِ ظُلُمَاتٌ (within it are darknesses)**

* Plural: *darknesses* — layers of fear, confusion, ignorance.
* Not just night’s darkness, but the terror of a storm where guidance is obscured.
* Spiritually: hypocrites find in revelation only “burdens” of rules, threats of punishment, confusion — so it feels dark to them.

**5. وَرَعْدٌ (and thunder)**

* Thunder’s **sound** represents terrifying warnings in Qur’ān.
* Loud, unavoidable, shaking the heart.
* It shakes them but does not guide them.

**6. وَبَرْقٌ (and lightning)**

* Lightning’s **sudden flashes** are like moments when truth becomes briefly clear — but it’s inconsistent.
* Hypocrites see glimpses of truth (moments of insight), then quickly fall back into darkness.

**7. يَجْعَلُونَ أَصَابِعَهُمْ فِي آذَانِهِم (they put their fingers in their ears)**

* *Aṣābiʿahum* (their fingers, not just tips) — exaggeration: as if they’re plugging their entire ears.
* Symbol of desperate rejection — trying to block out revelation’s thunderous warnings.

**8. مِنَ الصَّوَاعِقِ (against the thunderclaps)**

* *Ṣawāʿiq* from root ص ع ق: violent blasts, lightning strikes.
* Symbol of divine punishment — they fear it but cannot escape it.

**9. حَذَرَ الْمَوْتِ (fearing death)**

* Their reaction is not reverence, but raw self-preservation.
* Hypocrites fear worldly consequences, not the Hereafter.

**10. وَاللَّهُ مُحِيطٌ بِالْكَافِرِينَ (and Allah encompasses the disbelievers)**

* *Muḥīṭ*: encircling, surrounding from all sides, leaving no escape.
* Irony: they try to block ears and escape the storm — yet Allah already has them surrounded.
* Their attempts at avoidance are useless.
##### **Rhetorical & Spiritual Insights**
* This parable is **more terrifying** than the fire-light one.
* In Ayah 17, the issue was loss of guidance (light extinguished).
* Here, the issue is **terror and panic** — every sound of revelation feels like death.
* The vividness:
  * **Darknesses** → confusion.
  * **Thunder** → warnings shaking them.
  * **Lightning** → brief insights of truth.
  * **Finger plugging** → futile avoidance.
* The climax: *“Allah encompasses the disbelievers”* — the storm is not just weather; it is the divine reality they cannot escape.

✦ **Reflections**
Hypocrisy is not peaceful. Inside, it is stormy: flashes of truth terrify, warnings shake, and death looms near. While believers find revelation like nourishing rain, hypocrites experience it as a storm of doom.

# **Āyah 20**

يَكَادُ ٱلۡبَرۡقُ يَخۡطَفُ أَبۡصَـٰرَهُمۡۖ كُلَّمَآ أَضَآءَ لَهُم مَّشَوۡاْ فِيهِ وَإِذَآ أَظۡلَمَ عَلَيۡهِمۡ قَامُواْۚ وَلَوۡ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَذَهَبَ بِسَمۡعِهِمۡ وَأَبۡصَـٰرِهِمۡۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيۡءٖ قَدِيرُۢ

*The lightning almost snatches away their sight. Whenever it shines for them, they walk in it, but when darkness covers them, they stand still. And if Allah willed, He could take away their hearing and their sight. Indeed, Allah is over all things Most Powerful.*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

**1. يَكَادُ ٱلۡبَرۡقُ (yakādu al-barqu – the lightning almost)**

* *Yakādu* = nearly, almost, on the verge.
* *Al-barq* = lightning, sudden flashes.
* This portrays the Qur’ān’s truths as so intense, they nearly overwhelm hypocrites’ inner vision.

**2. يَخۡطَفُ أَبۡصَـٰرَهُم (yakhtaṭifu abṣārahum – snatches away their sight)**

* *Yakhtaṭif* from خ ط ف = to seize violently, like a hawk snatching prey.
* Indicates their spiritual perception is unstable — flashes of truth nearly blind them instead of guiding them.

**3. كُلَّمَآ أَضَآءَ لَهُم مَّشَوۡاْ فِيهِ (whenever it lights up for them, they walk in it)**

* *Aḍāʾa* = gives light.
* *Mashaw fīhi* = they walk in it — momentarily guided.
* Hypocrites sometimes follow when revelation aligns with worldly benefit, or when truth is easy for them.

**4. وَإِذَآ أَظۡلَمَ عَلَيۡهِمۡ قَامُواْ (but when it becomes dark upon them, they stand still)**

* *Aẓlama* = to grow dark.
* *Qāmū* = stood still, paralyzed.
* When guidance requires sacrifice, struggle, or faith in the unseen — they freeze, refusing to act.

**5. وَلَوۡ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَذَهَبَ بِسَمۡعِهِمۡ وَأَبۡصَـٰرِهِمۡ (and if Allah willed, He could take away their hearing and their sight)**

* Their fragile faculties of perception remain only because of Allah’s mercy.
* At any moment, He could strip away the little “hearing” and “sight” they still have.

**6. إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيۡءٖ قَدِيرُۢ (Indeed Allah is over all things Powerful)**

* A conclusion of both parables (fire & storm):
  * Their states are not beyond Allah’s control.
  * Hypocrisy itself is within His power to expose, punish, or forgive.
##### **Rhetorical & Spiritual Nuances**
* The storm image is perfected here:
  * **Lightning** = brief moments of insight.
  * **Darkness** = overwhelming doubts and disbelief.
  * **Walking then freezing** = unstable faith, no consistency.
* Fire parable (Ayah 17) emphasized **loss of light**.
* Storm parable (Ayah 19–20) emphasized **terror, instability, and fragility**.
* Both together capture the hypocrite’s inner world: sometimes blinded, sometimes terrified, never steady.

✦ **Reflections**
A true believer has steady light — like the moon and sun, constant and life-giving. A hypocrite has only flashes, like lightning: dramatic, frightening, but fleeting. They live in half-light, half-darkness, swaying between fear and greed. Allah reminds: if He wills, even these fleeting glimpses can be taken away — leaving them in complete spiritual blindness.

## Rukūʿ 2: Summary

##### 1 — Defining the Hypocrites (8–9)
* They say *“We believe”* with their tongues, but their hearts are hollow.
* Their game is *deception* — thinking they trick Allah and the believers, yet in reality they trick only themselves.
✦ **Lesson:** Hypocrisy is not just disbelief; it is betrayal in disguise.
##### 2 — Their Inner Disease (10)
* Their hearts carry a disease — the disease of doubt, envy, arrogance.
* Allah lets this disease grow because of their own choices.
✦ **Lesson:** Sin allowed without repentance grows like an infection — what starts as a small crack becomes a full wound.
##### 3 — Their Public Claim vs. Reality (11–12)
* They parade as reformers (*“We are only making peace / fixing things”*).
* But Allah Himself declares: *“No! They are the corrupters — but they don’t perceive.”*
✦ **Lesson:** Hypocrites always disguise corruption as reform — moral inversion.
##### 4 — Their Mockery (13–16)
* When told to believe like others, they sneer: *“Shall we believe like the foolish do?”*
* In truth, **they are the foolish**, but they don’t know it.
* They think they’re clever — trading guidance for misguidance.
* Their “deal” leaves them bankrupt.
✦ **Lesson:** The hypocrite’s arrogance is their downfall — they think they are superior minds, but they are empty.
#####  5 — Parable 1: The Fire (17)
* Like someone who lights a fire: it gives light for a moment, then Allah snuffs it out, leaving them blind in the dark.
* Their brief light = the little faith they once showed, or moments of clarity.
* Darkness = their lasting confusion.
✦ **Lesson:** Hypocrisy begins with light (faith) but ends in pitch darkness if not sincere.
##### 6 — Parable 2: The Storm (18–20)
* A thunderstorm descends — darkness, thunder, lightning.
* They plug their ears out of fear, thinking they can escape death.
* Lightning gives them split-second clarity, then darkness engulfs them again.
* They walk only when light flashes — but never steady.
* Allah warns: if He wills, He could take away their sight and hearing completely.
✦ **Lesson:** The hypocrite’s faith is unstable — moments of clarity, then relapse; fear drives them, not conviction.
#### Flow of the Rukūʿ
* **Opening (8–9):** Identity of the hypocrites.
* **Middle (10–16):** Their disease, arrogance, and false claims.
* **Climax (17–20):** Parables exposing their inner state — instability, blindness, fear.
* **Closing (20):** Allah’s warning of His total power.

### ✦ **Grand Wisdom**
Disbelievers (Āyah 6–7) were described in just two āyāt — clear, simple, final.
But hypocrites (Āyah 8–20) take thirteen āyāt — because hypocrisy is subtle, dangerous, and destructive *from within*.

## **🕋 Divine Thread**

8. *And of the people are some who say, “We believe in Allah and the Last Day,” but they are not 'true' believers.*
9. *They \[hypocrites] try to deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive none except themselves, and they do not perceive it.*
10. *In their hearts is a disease, and Allah has increased their disease; and for them is a painful punishment because they used to lie.*
11. *And when it is said to them, “Do not cause corruption on the earth,” they say, “We are only reformers.”*
12. *Unquestionably, it is they who are the corrupters, but they do not perceive.*
13. *And when it is said to them, “Believe as the people have believed,” they say, “Shall we believe as the fools have believed?” Unquestionably, it is they who are the fools, but they do not know.*
14. *And when they meet those who believe, they say, “We believe,” but when they are alone with their devils, they say, “Indeed, we are with you; we were only mocking.”*
15. *Allah throws their mockery back at them and prolongs them in their transgression, wandering blindly.*
16. *They are the ones who purchased error in exchange for guidance, so their trade did not profit, and they were never guided.*
17. *Their example is like that of one who kindled a fire; then, when it illuminated what was around him, Allah took away their light and left them in darknesses, unable to see.*
18. *Deaf, dumb, blind – so they will not return.*
19. *Or like a rainstorm from the sky, within it are darknesses, thunder, and lightning. They place their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps, fearing death. But Allah encompasses the disbelievers.*
20. *The lightning almost snatches away their sight. Whenever it shines for them, they walk in it, but when darkness covers them, they stand still. And if Allah willed, He could take away their hearing and their sight. Indeed, Allah is over all things Most Powerful.*
