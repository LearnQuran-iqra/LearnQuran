**Rukūʿ 2 transitions into Rukūʿ 3 (Āyah 21 onwards)** — How Allah suddenly shifts from hypocrites to addressing _all of mankind_? That shift itself has deep rhetorical beauty.

# **Āyah 21**

يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ

*O mankind! Worship your Lord, the One who created you and those before you, so that you may attain taqwā (consciousness and protection of Allah).*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

#### **يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ** — *O mankind!*

* Allah now shifts from talking about believers, disbelievers, and hypocrites → to addressing *all humanity*.
* **“An-nās”** includes everyone, believer or not — a universal call.
* Unlike the previous ayāt, which exposed groups, here begins **direct da‘wah**.
✦ The style broadens: Allah is not just describing — He’s calling.

#### **اعْبُدُوا** — *Worship*

* Root: **ʿabd (عبد)** — servant, slave.
* ʿIbādah means full devotion, obedience, humility, and love combined.
* Not just ritual acts, but living life in recognition of His Lordship.
* In Qur’an style: **the very first command in the entire Qur’an is “worship”** — setting the foundation.

#### **رَبَّكُمُ** — *your Lord*

* Not “Allah” here, but **Rabb** — the One who nurtures, sustains, develops, and provides.
* By saying *your Rabb*, Allah reminds each person: “He is already raising and providing for you — so your devotion is due to Him.”
✦ Emotional pull: “He is YOUR Rabb” → personal, intimate, undeniable.

#### **الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ** — *Who created you and those before you*

* He is the one True **Creator**.
* Not just you, but all generations before you → proof of continuity and power.
* Implies: “The fact that you exist is the greatest evidence of His right to be worshipped.”

#### **لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ** — *So that you may attain taqwā*

* Taqwā = awareness, fear, protection, guarding oneself from Allah’s displeasure.
* Purpose of worship: not rituals for their own sake, but to awaken **protective consciousness of Allah**.
* “La‘alla” → conveys **hope and encouragement**: “so that perhaps you will gain taqwā.”
✦ Balāghah: Allah doesn’t say *so that you must* or *definitely will* — but *so that you may*. This softens the call, making it more welcoming.

**✦ Reflections**
* After exposing hypocrites, Allah turns to all people, calling them to the foundation: *ʿibādah*.
* The sequence is powerful:
  * **Disbelievers** (closed hearts).
  * **Hypocrites** (double-faced).
  * Then Allah says: *O all people — here is the true path.*
* The basis of worship is **Creator–creation relationship**.
✦ Worship is not a burden, but the natural response to the One who created and sustains.

---

Now let’s see how **this first command (worship)** is immediately followed by proofs in Ayah 22, where Allah lists His signs in creation. That way we see the **rhetorical build-up**.

# **Āyah 22**

ٱلَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلۡأَرۡضَ فِرَٲشً۬ا وَٱلسَّمَآءَ بِنَآءً۬ وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً۬ فَأَخۡرَجَ بِهِۦ مِنَ ٱلثَّمَرَٲتِ رِزۡقً۬ا لَّكُمۡۖ فَلَا تَجۡعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ أَندَادً۬ا وَأَنتُمۡ تَعۡلَمُونَ

*The One who made the earth for you as a resting place, and the sky as a canopy, and sent down water from the sky, then brought forth with it fruits as provision for you. So do not set up rivals to Allah while you know (the truth).*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

##### **ٱلَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلۡأَرۡضَ فِرَٲشً۬ا**

* *The One who made the earth for you as a bed/floor.*
* **Firaash (فِرَاش)** = something spread out, soft, comfortable, stable.
* The earth is not too hard (like stone), not too soft (like water) → perfectly designed for life.
* *“For you”* stresses that this was made **with your benefit in mind**.
✦ Subtle reminder: Your home itself (earth) is a sign of His Lordship.

##### **وَٱلسَّمَآءَ بِنَآءً۬**

* *And the sky as a canopy/structure.*
* **Bināʾ (بناء)** = solid, protective construction.
* Sky functions like a ceiling: protective atmosphere, stable, shielding from cosmic harm.
* Rhetoric: Pairs **earth-floor** and **sky-roof** → like a perfectly built house by Allah.

##### **وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً۬**

* *And He sent down from the sky, water.*
* Not just “rain,” but **māʾ** (water) — source of all life.
* The image is intimate: He *sent down* (انزل), an act of care.

##### **فَأَخۡرَجَ بِهِۦ مِنَ ٱلثَّمَرَٲتِ رِزۡقً۬ا لَّكُمۡ**

* *And brought forth with it fruits as provision for you.*
* “Thamarāt” = fruits of many kinds, varied, delicious.
* *For you* repeated → showing all of this is tailor-made for human benefit.
✦ Qur’anic tenderness: Provision is not abstract — it’s sweet, nourishing, enjoyable.

##### **فَلَا تَجۡعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ أَندَادً۬ا وَأَنتُمۡ تَعۡلَمُونَ**

* *So do not set up rivals (equals) to Allah while you know.*
* **Andād (أنداد)** = rivals, competitors, partners.
* The conclusion: Since He alone created, sustained, provided — how can you ascribe rivals?
* *“While you know”* — powerful rebuke. Deep down, they know idols didn’t create earth, sky, rain, fruits.

**✦ Reflections**
* Qur’an’s logic is breathtaking: **Command (worship) → Proofs (earth, sky, rain, fruits) → Warning (don’t set up rivals).**
* It appeals to **reason** (look at creation), **emotion** (all of this for you), and **conscience** (you know the truth).
* Balāghah: The ayah is like a courtroom argument — evidence stacked, verdict given.
✦ Worship, then, is not blind submission. It’s the most rational response to undeniable favors surrounding us.

---

Now Allah moves from **external signs in creation** (earth, sky, rain, fruits) to the **internal sign of revelation itself**: the Qur’an. The argument tightens: if you doubt the Qur’an, then produce something like it.

# **Āyah 23**

وَإِن كُنتُمۡ فِى رَيۡبٍ۬ مِّمَّا نَزَّلۡنَا عَلَىٰ عَبۡدِنَا فَأۡتُواْ بِسُورَةٍ۬ مِّن مِّثۡلِهِۦۖ وَٱدۡعُواْ شُهَدَآءَكُم مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ إِن كُنتُمۡ صَـٰدِقِينَ

*And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down upon Our servant, then produce a sūrah like it, and call upon your witnesses besides Allah, if you are truthful.*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

##### **وَإِن كُنتُمۡ فِى رَيۡبٍ۬**

* *If you are in doubt…*
* **Rayb (رَيب)** = doubt laced with disturbance, unease, suspicion. Not neutral doubt, but troubled, shaky doubt.
* The Qur’an recognizes that denial is not calm confidence, but uneasy disturbance inside.

##### **مِّمَّا نَزَّلۡنَا عَلَىٰ عَبۡدِنَا**
* *About what We sent down upon Our servant.*
* **Nazzalnā (نَزَّلنا)** = gradual, purposeful revelation.
* Allah calls the beloved Prophet Muhammad ﷺ *“Our servant”* — highest honor: servitude to Allah above all titles. ✦
* Rhetorical tenderness: revelation is a trust given to a beloved servant.

##### **فَأۡتُواْ بِسُورَةٍ۬ مِّن مِّثۡلِهِۦ**

* *Then produce a sūrah like it.*
* Even the **shortest sūrah** is a challenge.
* “Min mithlihi” = of its likeness — not identical, but equal in rhetorical, linguistic, spiritual weight.
* The Qur’an places the challenge within **reach in theory**, but impossible in reality.

##### **وَٱدۡعُواْ شُهَدَآءَكُم مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ**

* *And call upon your witnesses besides Allah.*
* **Shuhadāʾ (شُهَدَاء)** = helpers, supporters, experts, gods, poets, jinn — anyone they rely on.
* Rhetoric: call every helper you can muster — still impossible.

##### **إِن كُنتُمۡ صَـٰدِقِينَ**

* *If you are truthful.*
* Cuts to the heart: their denial is not truth-based, but arrogance-based.

**✦ Reflections**
* First, Allah showed **His creation signs** (earth, sky, rain, fruits). If they still deny, He now presents the **Qur’an itself** as the ultimate sign.
* The challenge is **open, public, perpetual**. No one has ever met it — this itself is a standing miracle.
* The tone is majestic yet piercing: doubt is exposed, the Prophet ﷺ is honored, and the Qur’an is presented as undefeatable proof.
✦ This āyah shifts the battlefield: from creation outside to the Book inside — the Qur’an itself becomes the unshakable evidence.

---

**Āyah 24** — Allah declares the **helplessness of deniers** and warns of Hellfire? This completes the logical arc: *signs → challenge → consequence.*

# **Āyah 24**

فَإِن لَّمۡ تَفۡعَلُواْ وَلَن تَفۡعَلُواْ فَٱتَّقُواْ ٱلنَّارَ ٱلَّتِى وَقُودُهَا ٱلنَّاسُ وَٱلۡحِجَارَةُۖ أُعِدَّتۡ لِلۡكَـٰفِرِينَ

*But if you do not — and you will never be able to — then guard yourselves against the Fire whose fuel is people and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

##### **فَإِن لَّمۡ تَفۡعَلُواْ**

* *So if you do not do it…*
* Refers back to the challenge of producing a sūrah like the Qur’an.
##### **وَلَن تَفۡعَلُواْ**

* *And you will never do it.*
* **“Lan” (لَن)** = absolute negation into the future — eternal impossibility.
* Not only have they failed so far — Allah **forecloses** every possibility forever.
* Rhetorical power: human arrogance crushed before even trying.

##### **فَٱتَّقُواْ ٱلنَّارَ**

* *Then guard yourselves against the Fire.*
* **Ittaqu (اتقوا)** = protect, shield yourself. The same way you take precautions against danger — now do so against Hellfire.

##### **ٱلَّتِى وَقُودُهَا ٱلنَّاسُ وَٱلۡحِجَارَةُ**

* *Whose fuel is people and stones.*
* Fire usually needs wood, oil, coal. Here, **humans themselves** become fuel.
* **Ḥijārah (حجارة)** — stones. Most commentators mention:
  * **Idols** carved from stone, which they worshipped. They and their gods burn together.
  * Or sulfur-stones, which burn fiercely with thick black smoke — more terrifying than normal fire.
* Imagery: total humiliation — worshippers and their false gods consumed as fuel.

##### **أُعِدَّتۡ لِلۡكَـٰفِرِينَ**

* *Prepared for the disbelievers.*
* Past tense “uʿiddat” = already made ready.
* Hell is not “in progress” — it already exists, waiting.
* Certainty and immediacy: the threat is not abstract, but real and present.

**✦ Reflections**
* **Certainty vs. doubt**: they doubted the Qur’an, but Allah responds with certainty — “you will never do it.”
* **Mercy inside warning**: the command “fa-ittaqu” (so protect yourselves) shows Allah still urges them to repent and guard themselves before it’s too late.
* **Psychological effect**: The Ayah doesn’t just threaten — it visualizes: *you as fuel, your idols beside you, fire already burning, waiting.*
* **Finality**: Denial is not just intellectual arrogance; it has eternal consequences.

✦ The movement of these āyāt is perfect:
	1. Creation signs (earth, sky, rain, fruits).
	2. Qur’an as final proof (challenge).
	3. The warning of Fire for failure.

**Āyah 25** — Allah immediately balances this terrifying image with the promise of **Gardens for the believers** The beauty of Jannah. The Qur’an always balances fear with hope.

# **Āyah 25**

وَبَشِّرِ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّـٰلِحَـٰتِ أَنَّ لَهُمۡ جَنَّـٰتٍ۬ تَجۡرِى مِن تَحۡتِهَا ٱلۡأَنۡهَـٰرُۖ كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنۡهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ۬ رِّزۡقً۬اۙ قَالُواْ هَـٰذَا ٱلَّذِى رُزِقۡنَا مِن قَبۡلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِۦ مُتَشَـٰبِهً۬اۖ وَلَهُمۡ فِيهَآ أَزۡوَٲجٌ۬ مُّطَهَّرَةٌ۬ۖ وَهُمۡ فِيهَا خَـٰلِدُونَ

*And give glad tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds: that for them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with fruit from it as provision, they will say, “This is what we were provided with before,” and it will be given to them in resemblance. And they will have purified spouses therein, and they will abide therein forever.*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

##### **وَبَشِّرِ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّـٰلِحَـٰتِ**

* *Give glad tidings to those who believed and did righteous deeds.*
* The Qur’an ties **īmān** with **ʿamal ṣāliḥ** — faith is not abstract, it must flower into good works.
* “Bashshir” = good news that brings joy and comfort, opposite of the terrifying warning just before.

##### **جَنَّـٰتٍ۬ تَجۡرِى مِن تَحۡتِهَا ٱلۡأَنۡهَـٰرُ**

* *Gardens beneath which rivers flow.*
* Plural “Jannāt” = multiple gardens, vast variety.
* Rivers “beneath” — not beside — showing gardens elevated, water flowing gracefully below.
* Symbol of eternal freshness, beauty, and no decay.

##### **كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنۡهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ۬ رِّزۡقً۬ا قَالُواْ هَـٰذَا ٱلَّذِى رُزِقۡنَا مِن قَبۡلُ**

* *Whenever they are provided fruits as provision, they will say: “This is what we were provided with before.”*
* Scholars say:
  * Fruits look similar outwardly, but each bite has **a new, richer taste**.
  * Every experience is familiar, yet eternally new — no boredom in Paradise.
* Rhetorical beauty: repetition without monotony, eternal freshness.

##### **وَأُتُواْ بِهِۦ مُتَشَـٰبِهً۬ا**

* *And they will be brought it resembling one another.*
* Outward resemblance — inwardly different taste, fragrance, delight.
* Suggests Paradise’s gifts always surprise, yet feel familiar — psychological comfort + excitement.

##### **وَلَهُمۡ فِيهَآ أَزۡوَٲجٌ۬ مُّطَهَّرَةٌ۬**

* *And for them therein are purified spouses.*
* “Muṭahharah” = purified from all human flaws (jealousy, illness, impurity, fatigue).
* Companionship in Jannah is free of pain, only joy and intimacy.

##### **وَهُمۡ فِيهَا خَـٰلِدُونَ**

* *And they will abide therein forever.*
* The most soothing ending: permanence.
* Every joy in dunya carries fear of ending — in Jannah, no ending. Eternity seals the bliss.

**✦ Reflections**
* The Qur’an paints **contrast**:
  * Hell: fuel = humans & stones, torment, humiliation.
  * Jannah: rivers, fruits, purified companionship, eternity.
* **Psychological wisdom**: hearts need balance between fear and hope. Allah gives both in perfect rhythm.
* **Spiritual meaning**: every fruit in Jannah feels “like before” but each time better — just like faith and Qur’an in dunya: familiar words, yet every time you return, new sweetness opens. ✦

## **Āyah 21 - 25**

Let’s close this **mini-sequence from āyah 21 to 25 (the “worship–challenge–fire–garden” cycle)
#### Recap of the Flow
* **Āyah 21**: Command — *worship your Lord* (foundation of faith).
* **Āyah 22**: Reminder of blessings — earth, sky, rain, fruits (proofs of His lordship).
* **Āyah 23**: Challenge — if you doubt this Qur’an, bring a sūrah like it (intellectual test).
* **Āyah 24**: Warning — if you fail, beware of the Fire, fuelled by people and stones (consequence for rejecting).
* **Āyah 25**: Contrast — for the believers, glad tidings of gardens beneath which rivers flow, with pure spouses and eternal comfort (reward for accepting).
#### Beauty of the Closure (Āyah 25)
The sequence forms a **complete rhetorical circle**:
  1. **Command** (worship)
  2. **Proofs** (creation)
  3. **Challenge** (produce a sūrah)
  4. **Threat** (Fire)
  5. **Promise** (Garden)

* This contrast between **Fire vs. Garden** is the Qur’an’s hallmark of **balāghah (rhetoric)**: after painting the terror of rejection, it immediately soothes with the hope of reward — keeping the listener’s heart between **fear (khawf)** and **hope (rajāʾ)**.

* Note also the **symmetry of imagery**:
  * *Fire fueled by stones* vs. *Gardens with rivers flowing beneath*.
  * Harsh, dry, burning vs. lush, cool, flowing.
  * *eternal punishment* vs. *eternal comfort*.

**Āyah 25 seals the section** — the argument is no longer intellectual alone but **emotional and spiritual**, leaving the audience with a vivid choice: *eternal fire or eternal garden*.

**Āyah 26** — Allah introduces the parables, like the mosquito, to explain guidance and misguidance

# **Āyah 26**

إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَسْتَحْيِي أَنْ يَضْرِبَ مَثَلًا مَا بَعُوضَةً فَمَا فَوْقَهَا ۚ فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا فَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ ۖ وَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا فَيَقُولُونَ مَاذَا أَرَادَ اللَّهُ بِهَٰذَا مَثَلًا ۘ يُضِلُّ بِهِ كَثِيرًا وَيَهْدِي بِهِ كَثِيرًا ۚ وَمَا يُضِلُّ بِهِ إِلَّا الْفَاسِقِينَ

*Indeed, Allah does not shy away from presenting a parable—even of a gnat, or what is above it. So those who believe know that it is the truth from their Lord. But those who disbelieve say, “What did Allah intend by this parable?” Through it He misleads many, and through it He guides many. But He does not mislead with it except the defiantly disobedient.*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

* **إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَسْتَحْيِي**

  * *Allah does not shy away.*
    The verb *yastaḥyī* comes from *ḥayā’* (modesty/shame). Used here in negation, it affirms that Allah has no reluctance in employing any image, no matter how small or “insignificant,” to convey truth. ✦ This choice emphasizes that divine speech is unbound by human cultural notions of “greatness.”

* **أَنْ يَضْرِبَ مَثَلًا مَا بَعُوضَةً**

  * *to strike (give) a parable, even of a gnat.*
    The verb *yaḍrib* is powerful—it literally means “to strike,” suggesting force, clarity, and impact. The parable is something struck into the mind.
  * *ba‘ūḍah* (gnat, mosquito) is among the smallest perceptible creatures—chosen intentionally for contrast: even the tiniest being carries signs of divine wisdom.
  * The particle **ما** here has been debated:
    1. Some said it means *even as little as* (to stress minuteness).
    2. Others said it means *that which is* (so: “a parable that is a gnat”).

* **فَمَا فَوْقَهَا**

  * *or what is above it.*
    This has two interpretations:
    1. Greater in *size* (camel, elephant, etc.).
    2. Greater in *refinement of creation* (something even subtler and smaller, like microbes).
       ✦ The openness of the phrase widens reflection—whether big or small, everything is a sign.

* **فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا...**

  * *As for those who believe, they know it is the truth from their Lord.*
    The believer’s lens is trust—they don’t measure revelation against pride but recognize its wisdom.

* **وَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا...**

  * *But those who disbelieve say: What did Allah intend by this parable?*
    Instead of reflection, they question mockingly. The structure contrasts believers’ certainty vs. disbelievers’ doubt.

* **يُضِلُّ بِهِ كَثِيرًا وَيَهْدِي بِهِ كَثِيرًا**

  * *He misleads by it many, and guides by it many.*
    A striking rhetorical balance—same tool (parable), two outcomes. Guidance/misguidance doesn’t come from the parable itself but from the hearts receiving it.

* **وَمَا يُضِلُّ بِهِ إِلَّا الْفَاسِقِينَ**

  * *But He does not mislead by it except the defiantly disobedient.*
    *Fāsiqīn* (from *fisq*: to come out, like a seed breaking its shell) — means those who have broken away from obedience.
    ✦ Thus, misguidance is not imposed—it is a consequence of their own corruption, while the parable itself is a light for receptive hearts.

**✦ Reflections**
* The ayah asserts that **no example is too small** to convey truth. A mosquito carries signs of divine artistry equal to the stars.
* The Qur’an’s rhetoric here exposes psychology: believers see *ḥaqq* (truth), while disbelievers see *mockery/confusion*. The same ayah reveals inner states.
* The use of *yudillu… yahdī* in one sentence shows that guidance and misguidance are two sides of the same event—it is the **heart’s orientation** that decides.

---

**Ayah 27** gives the first concrete example of a parable in this series — the corrupted path and heart imagery — linking it back to the hypocrites. This continues the rhetorical thread beautifully.

# **Āyah 27**

الَّذِينَ يَنقُضُونَ عَهْدَ اللَّهِ مِن بَعْدِ مِيثَاقِهِ وَيَقْطَعُونَ مَا أَمَرَ اللَّهُ بِهِ أَن يُوصَلَ وَيُفْسِدُونَ فِي الْأَرْضِ ۚ أُولَـٰئِكَ هُمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ

*Those who break Allah’s covenant after making it, and sever what Allah has commanded to be joined, and spread corruption on the earth — they are the ones who will be the losers.*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

##### **الَّذِينَ يَنقُضُونَ عَهْدَ اللَّهِ**

* *Those who break Allah’s covenant*
* **Naqada (نقض)** = to tear apart, annul, or violate.
* This covenant refers broadly to promises, obligations, and moral commitments — both spiritual and social.
* Rhetorical effect: the parable begins with **trust violated**, linking outward action to inner moral decay.

##### **مِن بَعْدِ مِيثَاقِهِ**

* *After making it (His covenant)*
* Highlights **deliberate betrayal** — they had committed themselves, yet they choose violation.
* Suggests hypocrisy: outward acceptance vs. inner denial.

##### **وَيَقْطَعُونَ مَا أَمَرَ اللَّهُ بِهِ أَن يُوصَلَ**

* *And sever what Allah has commanded to be joined*
* **Wasl** = connection, bond, union.
* Can refer to family ties, social bonds, or even spiritual unity.
* **Key rhetorical contrast**: believers *connect*, hypocrites/disbelievers *sever*.

##### **وَيُفْسِدُونَ فِي الْأَرْضِ**

* *And spread corruption on the earth*
* **Ifsād** = disorder, moral and social decay, injustice, misguidance.
* The Qur’an links broken covenants and broken bonds directly to **tangible corruption**.

##### **أُولَـٰئِكَ هُمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ**

* *They are the ones who will be the losers*
* **Khāsirūn** = absolute losers in this world and the next.
* The Ayah closes the parable with **clear moral causality**: betrayal → severing bonds → corruption → ultimate loss.

**✦ Reflections**
* This is the **first concrete parable** following Ayah 26’s introduction.
* It parallels the **hypocrites** described earlier (Ayah 8–20) but expands it to all who betray covenants and social/moral duties.
* The structure is deliberate:
	  1. **Violation of trust** (internal/psychological).
	  2. **Breaking bonds** (social).
	  3. **Corruption in the world** (external/action).
	  4. **Ultimate loss** (consequence).
* Rhetorical beauty: the Qur’an uses **cause → effect → moral judgment**, making abstract concepts concrete.
✦ This parable prepares the reading for the **next ayah (28)**, which gives a vivid, almost allegorical image of the blind, deaf, and hearts sealed — showing the state of the truly lost.

# **Āyah 28**

كَيْفَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَكُنتُمْ أَمْوَاتًا فَأَحْيَاكُمْ ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ

*How can you disbelieve in Allah, when you were lifeless and He gave you life, then He will cause you to die, then He will bring you back to life, and then to Him you will be returned?*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

##### **كَيْفَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِاللَّهِ**

* *How can you disbelieve in Allah?*
* **Kayfa** expresses astonishment, a rebuke: disbelief is **illogical** in the face of clear evidence.
* Rhetorical effect: a question that shames, exposes absurdity.

##### **وَكُنتُمْ أَمْوَاتًا فَأَحْيَاكُمْ**

* *When you were lifeless and He gave you life*
* Refers to being **non-existent (before birth)**, or in the womb without spirit, then Allah granted life.
* Deep rhetorical power: **from nothingness → to being**.
* A reminder: life itself is a sign and covenant.

##### **ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ**

* *Then He will cause you to die*
* Death is certain — placed as the natural sequence after life.
* Verb tense: **immediate and unavoidable**.

##### **ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ**

* *Then He will bring you back to life*
* Refers to resurrection (Qiyāmah).
* Structurally mirrors the first giving of life → rhetorical effect: **as the first life was certain, the second is equally certain**.

##### **ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ**

* *Then to Him you will be returned*
* Finality: all cycles of existence end in **Allah’s presence**.
* The passive form **turjaʿūn** emphasizes inevitability — whether you want it or not.

**✦ Reflections**
* This āyah is a **direct rational argument** against kufr:
	  1. From nothing → given life.
	  2. Life → death.
	  3. Death → life again.
	  4. Return to Allah.
* The sequence is **linear, inescapable, and logical**.
* Rhetorically: it ties human existence itself to Allah’s will, making disbelief a denial of one’s own reality.
✦ A powerful reminder: our very breath is proof of Allah. Disbelief isn’t just sin — it’s **irrational self-denial**.

**Āyah 29** continues creation imagery, from the heavens and earth

# **Āyah 29**

هُوَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ لَكُمْ مَا فِي الْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا ثُمَّ اسْتَوَىٰ إِلَى السَّمَاءِ فَسَوَّاهُنَّ سَبْعَ سَمَاوَاتٍ ۚ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ

*It is He who created for you all that is in the earth. Then He turned towards the heaven and fashioned them into seven heavens. And He is Knowing of everything.*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

##### **هُوَ الَّذِي**

* *It is He who…*
* Opening with **He** gives exclusivity — Allah alone, none else.
* Rhetorical force: **emphasis on uniqueness of the Creator**.

##### **خَلَقَ لَكُمْ مَا فِي الْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا**

* *Created for you all that is in the earth, entirely.*
* **Lakum (for you):** central — creation is made **for human benefit** (resources, livelihood, lessons).
* **Jamīʿan (all/entirely):** nothing excluded — completeness emphasized.
* Reminder: humans are beneficiaries, not owners.

##### **ثُمَّ اسْتَوَىٰ إِلَى السَّمَاءِ**

* *Then He turned towards the heaven*
* **Istawā ilā**: not spatial movement (Allah is exalted above place), but turning attention, directing will, focusing command.
* Order: first earth prepared for human life, then heavens organized — showing Allah’s deliberate planning.

##### **فَسَوَّاهُنَّ سَبْعَ سَمَاوَاتٍ**

* *And fashioned them into seven heavens*
* **Sawwa (to proportion, perfect, balance):** emphasizes harmony and precision in creation.
* The **seven heavens**: layered cosmic order — vastness beyond human perception.

##### **وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ**

* *And He is Knowing of everything*
* Closing with **knowledge attribute**: ties creation to **perfect wisdom**.
* The design of earth and heavens is neither random nor meaningless — all under divine knowledge.

**✦ Reflections**
* The āyah **connects human life to the cosmos**:
	* Earth made for humans.
	* Heavens perfected for divine order.
* It builds a **cosmic perspective**: man is central but still a servant — Allah is the Knower, Planner, Sustainer.
✦ Reminder: every resource we enjoy is a **gift of divine mercy**; ingratitude is blindness to this cosmic truth.

## Rukūʿ 3: Summary
* **21–22** → The universal call: *“O mankind, worship your Lord…”* — establishing Tawḥīd and rubūbiyyah (Lordship).
* **23–24** → The Qur’an’s *challenge* to produce even one sūrah like it — proving divine origin.
* **25** → Glad tidings of Jannah for believers.
* **26–27** → Parables (like the mosquito) — guidance vs. misguidance.
* **28** → Reflection on life, death, and resurrection — Allah’s power over existence.
* **29** → Allah’s creation of earth and heavens — establishing His absolute knowledge and authority.

✦ So this rukūʿ **moves from human obligation to worship**, to **proof of Qur’an’s divinity**, to **reward and punishment**, to **cosmic perspective of creation**.

## **🕋 Divine Thread**

21. *O mankind! Worship your Lord, the One who created you and those before you, so that you may attain taqwā (consciousness and protection of Allah).*
22. *The One who made the earth for you as a resting place, and the sky as a canopy, and sent down water from the sky, then brought forth with it fruits as provision for you. So do not set up rivals to Allah while you know (the truth).*
23. *And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down upon Our servant, then produce a sūrah like it, and call upon your witnesses besides Allah, if you are truthful.*
24. *But if you do not — and you will never be able to — then guard yourselves against the Fire whose fuel is people and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.*
25. *And give glad tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds: that for them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with fruit from it as provision, they will say, “This is what we were provided with before,” and it will be given to them in resemblance. And they will have purified spouses therein, and they will abide therein forever.*
26. *Indeed, Allah does not shy away from presenting a parable—even of a gnat, or what is above it. So those who believe know that it is the truth from their Lord. But those who disbelieve say, “What did Allah intend by this parable?” Through it He misleads many, and through it He guides many. But He does not mislead with it except the defiantly disobedient.*
27. *Those who break Allah’s covenant after making it, and sever what Allah has commanded to be joined, and spread corruption on the earth — they are the ones who will be the losers.*
28. *How can you disbelieve in Allah, when you were lifeless and He gave you life, then He will cause you to die, then He will bring you back to life, and then to Him you will be returned?*
29. *It is He who created for you all that is in the earth. Then He turned towards the heaven and fashioned them into seven heavens. And He is Knowing of everything.*
