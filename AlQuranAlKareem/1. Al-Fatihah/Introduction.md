## **Surah Name: Al-Fatiha (سورة الفاتحة) — The Opening**  
***Surah Number: 1***
***Number of Ayaat: 7***

The Surah is named Al-Fatiha because “Fatiha” means “opening” or “preface.”
Scholars emphasizes several reasons why this surah carries this name:
##### 1. **It Opens the Qur’an**
- Al-Fātiḥah is the **first surah** of the Qur’an, so it literally opens the Book.
- It serves as a **gateway** into the Qur’anic message, preparing the reader or reciter spiritually and intellectually.
##### 2. **It Opens the Heart**
* The surah begins with **praise of Allah**, recognition of His mercy, and acknowledgment of His sovereignty.
* By reciting it, the believer’s heart is **opened to divine guidance**, humility, and devotion.
* It sets the **spiritual tone** for understanding all other surahs.
##### 3. **It Opens the Way to Guidance**
* The last Ayaat are a **direct supplication for the straight path**:
  ✦ “Guide us to the straight path, the path of those You have favored…”
* In this sense, the surah **opens the way to ethical, spiritual, and moral clarity** for the believer.
##### 4. **It Opens Daily Worship**
* Al-Fātiḥah is recited in **every unit of prayer (Salah)**.
* It **opens the communication** between the believer and Allah in every act of worship, making it a perpetual spiritual opener.
##### **Literal Meaning**
* **Root:** ف-ت-ح (**Fā-Tā-Ḥā**)
  * Core meaning: *to open, to unlock, to initiate, to conquer*.
* **Form:** **الفَاعِلَة (Al-Fā‘ilah)**
  * Pattern indicates **the one or the act that opens**.
  * In this case, it is **verbal-noun/active participle sense**, meaning *“the opener”* or *“the act of opening”*.

### Why **Al-Fātiḥah** is also called **“Umm al-Kitāb” (Mother of the Book)**
##### 1. **Literal Meaning of Umm al-Kitāb**
* “Umm” literally means **mother**, and in Qur’anic terminology, it refers to the **source, essence, or summary** of something.
* So, **Umm al-Kitāb** means: *the essence or core of the Qur’an*.
##### 2. **Why this Title linked to Al-Fātiḥah**
**(A) Essence of the Qur’an’s Message**
* Al-Fātiḥah contains the **core spiritual principles** of the entire Qur’an:
	  1. Praise of Allah (*Lordship and mercy*)
	  2. Recognition of accountability (*Day of Judgment*)
	  3. Devotion and exclusive worship
	  4. Supplication for guidance (*straight path*)
* Every other surah **expands, explains, and applies** these principles in detail.

**(B) Spiritual and Practical Blueprint**
* Al-Fātiḥah **prepares the heart** to receive divine guidance, which is then **applied practically in later surahs** like al-Baqarah (laws, social order) and al-Nisā’ (justice, governance).
* In this sense, it is **motherly**, nurturing the believer’s understanding before growth into full Qur’anic guidance.

**(C) Comprehensive in Seven Ayaat**
* Despite being only **seven Ayaat**, it encapsulates **the Qur’an’s entire framework**: faith, worship, ethics, guidance, accountability, and divine favor.
* This compactness is why scholars call it **Umm al-Kitāb** — it contains the “seed” of the Qur’an.

### Approximate Time of Revelation
Revealed in the early stages of the Meccan period and considered to be the first complete Surah revealed to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

### Historical Context
Surah Al-Fatiha holds a significant place in the Quran as the opening chapter and is considered one of the earliest revelations. It was revealed during the early period of the Prophet Muhammad’s (peace be upon him) prophethood in Makkah. Scholars agree on its early origin, and it is reported to be the first complete Surah revealed, following isolated Ayaat from other surahs.

This Surah is central to the daily prayers (Salah) of Muslims, highlighting its importance in Islamic worship. Evidence of its early revelation is found in the mandatory recitation of Al-Fatiha in every prayer, including the prayers that were established during the Makkah period. Additionally, a Ayaat in Surah Al-Hijr (15:87), which refers to the “seven oft-repeated Ayaat,” is believed to allude to Al-Fatiha, supporting the notion of its early revelation in Makkah.

The Surah introduces core Islamic concepts, such as monotheism, the relationship between humans and Allah, and the necessity of seeking guidance. It is viewed as both a foundational prayer and an introductory message to the Quran, emphasizing the importance of relying on Allah for guidance in life. For early Muslims, it served not only as a spiritual guideline but also as a reminder of their dependence on Allah amidst their struggles in the challenging early days of Islam in Makkah.
