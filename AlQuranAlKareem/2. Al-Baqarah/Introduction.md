## **Surah Name: Al-Baqarah (سورة البقرة) — The Cow**
***Surah Number:** 2*  
***Number of Ayaat:** 286*

The name comes from **Ayaat 67–73**, which narrates the story of the **cow commanded by Allah to the Israelites**.
The Israelites were commanded to **slaughter a cow** as a test of obedience and submission.
This story is **unique in the Qur’an** and symbolically significant, highlighting **obedience to divine command even when the reason is not fully understood**.

##### **Literal Meaning**
* **البقرة** 
* literally means *“the cow”*.
* The root is **ب-ق-ر (B-Q-R)**, which generally conveys the idea of **splitting, cutting, or goring** in Arabic.
	* From this root, **بقر (baqar)** is used for **a cow or bovine animal**, because cows are traditionally known for their **strong, goring nature and physical strength**.

### Why the Surah Was Named After This Story
* Even though the story is only a **small part** of the surah, it encapsulates **a central theme of the surah**:
  ✦ The need for **faithful obedience** to Allah’s commands.
  ✦ The consequences of **hesitation, stubbornness, or questioning divine wisdom excessively**.
* The surah contains many lessons on **guidance, law, discipline, and community order**, and this story is a **microcosm of those principles**: a society must obey Allah, not merely rely on reasoning or whims.
* Classical scholars, like **al-Tabari and al-Qurtubi**, also mention that the name is **from a notable incident within the surah**, not from its main theme.
* This naming is **typical of Qur’anic style**: sometimes surahs are named after **a distinctive story or word** rather than their full thematic content.
✦ The name *Al-Baqarah* reminds the reader that **obedience to Allah is the cornerstone of faith**, just as the Israelites’ obedience (or lack thereof) in the story illustrates the perils of doubt, delay, or defiance.

### Approximate Time of Revelation
The majority of the surah was revealed during the first two years of the Prophet’s life in Madinah. Some later Ayaat were revealed afterward, but the thematic continuity led to their inclusion in this surah. The revelation of this surah may have occurred over a span of nine to ten years. The final Ayah (Ayah 281) may have been the last Ayah of the entire Qur’an to be revealed.

### Historical Context
Surah Al-Baqarah, the longest surah in the Quran, was revealed over several years during the Prophet Muhammad’s (ﷺ) time in Madinah, following the Hijrah (migration) from Makkah. The surah addresses the new challenges faced by the Muslim community as they transitioned from living under persecution in Makkah to establishing themselves as a collective society in Madinah.

At Makkah, Islam primarily addressed the polytheistic Quraysh; however, after migrating to Madinah, the Prophet encountered other religious communities, particularly Jews. The Jewish tribes in Madinah had beliefs similar in some respects to Islam—such as the oneness of Ayah, prophethood, and the concept of the Hereafter—but they had strayed from the teachings of their scriptures and clung to ritualistic practices that had lost their spiritual essence. These Jewish tribes also resisted and opposed the Prophet’s message, despite the similarities between it and their own faith.

This surah was revealed to address these tensions with the Jewish community, their history, and their spiritual decline. It critiques the Israelites’ failure to uphold the truth, contrasts their misguidance with the truth of Islam, and offers a clear path forward for the Muslim community. Additionally, the surah focuses on establishing a social, economic, and legal framework essential for the new Islamic society. It discusses matters such as leadership, justice, charity, family law, faith, and the importance of unity among Muslims.

Furthermore, the surah addresses the appearance of hypocrites (munafiqin) who pretended to follow Islam while secretly undermining it from within. Thus, it served as both a guide for personal conduct and a legal framework as the Muslim community established itself both spiritually and politically.

## **Preview of the Sūrah**

### Central Theme (‘Umūd)
*How a newly forming Muslim Ummah should establish faith, discipline, and societal order under Allah’s guidance.
It is about laying the foundation of the Muslim Ummah: belief first, then worship, then societal order, and finally reliance on Allah in all affairs.
It serves as a **manual for the new Muslim Ummah**, linking faith to societal responsibility.*

### Main Themes
- **Divine Guidance and Categories of Mankind:**  
    Al-Baqarah starts with the affirmation that the Quran is a guide for humanity, classifying people into three groups: believers, disbelievers, and hypocrites. The surah highlights the importance of adhering to divine guidance and how different groups react to it.
    
- **Call to Worship Allah Alone:**  
    Allah invites humanity to recognize Him as the Creator and Sustainer of the universe, urging them to follow His guidance and submit to Him alone. This central message is reinforced through stories of past prophets and their communities, emphasizing submission to divine will.
    
- **Story of Adam and Human Struggle:**  
    The story of Adam’s creation, his fall due to Satan’s temptation, and his repentance symbolizes the human condition. The surah teaches mankind to seek forgiveness and follow the guidance in the face of temptation and weakness, as seen with Adam.
    
- **Warnings to the Children of Israel:**  
    A large portion of the surah addresses the Jews, reviewing their history and moral decline, and calling them to reform by accepting the guidance brought by Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The surah recalls their deviation from the Torah’s teachings and emphasizes that Muhammad (peace be upon him) continues the same divine message.
    
- **Changing of the Qiblah (Direction of Prayer):**  
    The surah announces the change of the direction of prayer from Jerusalem to the Kaaba in Makkah.
    
- **Establishment of Laws and Social Practices:**  
    The surah lays down essential laws and principles for Muslims on matters such as prayer (Salah), fasting (Sawm), charity (Zakat), pilgrimage (Hajj), and justice. It addresses social issues like marriage, divorce, inheritance, and deals with financial matters like the prohibition of interest (Riba), stressing ethical behavior in societal interactions.
    
- **Moral and Spiritual Discipline:**  
    Muslims are reminded to develop patience, self-restraint, and moral integrity. The surah encourages believers to bear hardships and trials with fortitude, reminding them that ultimate success lies in sincerity towards Allah and adherence to His guidance.
    
- **Struggle and Sacrifice (Jihad):**  
    The concept of Jihad is introduced in various forms: striving for personal betterment, resisting temptations, and defending the faith from external threats. The surah uses historical examples, such as Prophet David’s triumph over Goliath, to illustrate the notion that faith, discipline, and perseverance lead to success.
    
- **Ayat Al-Kursi:**  
    Al-Baqarah includes the important “Ayat Al-Kursi" (2:255), which describes the majesty, power, and knowledge of Allah. It serves as a reminder of Ayah’s omnipotence and His control over all affairs in the heavens and on earth.
    
- **Prohibition of Interest (Riba):**  
    A key social and economic principle established is the prohibition of interest. The surah warns against the evil of usury.
    
- **Final Reminders and Prayers:**  
    The surah concludes by recapitulating the basic articles of faith and with a beautiful prayer asking Allah for mercy, forgiveness, and guidance. The prayer acknowledges that human beings may fall short in fully adhering to Ayah’s guidance and thus regularly seek His aid.
