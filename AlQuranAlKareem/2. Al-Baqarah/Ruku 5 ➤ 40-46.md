**Rukūʿ 5 (Āyah 40 onwards)**, turns directly to **Banī Isrā’īl** and their covenant.

# **Āyah 40**

يَا بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ اذْكُرُوا نِعْمَتِيَ الَّتِي أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَأَوْفُوا بِعَهْدِي أُوفِ بِعَهْدِكُمْ وَإِيَّايَ فَارْهَبُونِ

*O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I bestowed upon you, and fulfill My covenant, I will fulfill your covenant. And Me alone, so be in awe of Me.*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

* **يَا بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ** – “O Children of Israel”
  A direct address to Banī Isrā’īl (descendants of Prophet Ya‘qūb عليه السلام). The Qur’an uses this lineage title instead of “O Jews” (يَا أَيُّهَا الْيَهُودُ) to remind them of their noble ancestor, urging them to live up to his faithfulness.

* **اذْكُرُوا** – “Remember”
  The verb carries both intellectual and emotional weight: *recall* with the mind and *acknowledge with gratitude* in the heart. It is not mere recollection but active remembrance that leads to obedience.

* **نِعْمَتِيَ الَّتِي أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ** – “My favor which I bestowed upon you”
  Singular **نِعْمَتِيَ** points to the totality of favors as *one unified blessing* despite their multiplicity (freedom from Pharaoh, manna & quails, Torah, prophets, kingdom). This emphasizes that all divine blessings are interconnected, flowing from one divine source.

* **وَأَوْفُوا بِعَهْدِي** – “And fulfill My covenant”
  Refers to their covenant of faith and obedience: worship none but Allah, believe in His messengers, uphold the Torah sincerely, and later accept the final Messenger ﷺ.

* **أُوفِ بِعَهْدِكُمْ** – “I will fulfill your covenant”
  A reciprocal promise: if you remain true, I will give you My promised support—victory, forgiveness, Paradise. Notice the symmetry in wording: *أوفوا* / *أوفِ* (balance and justice in divine dealing).

* **وَإِيَّايَ فَارْهَبُونِ** – “And Me alone, so be in awe of Me”
  The pronoun **إِيَّايَ** (Me alone) is placed at the beginning, creating exclusivity (taqdīm for ḥaṣr): *fear none but Me.*
  The verb **فَارْهَبُونِ** (be in awe, revere with fear) expresses not mere fear, but a trembling reverence—recognition of majesty mixed with caution against betrayal.

**✦ Reflections**
- Allah begins His direct address to Banī Isrā’īl with *reminder of blessings before commands*. This shows divine gentleness: gratitude is the foundation of obedience.
- The balance: *You fulfill → I fulfill*. Allah’s promises are perfectly just, unlike human contracts that may be broken.
- The placement of **Me alone, so fear Me** cuts off all other fears—whether fear of nations, kings, or worldly loss. True covenant is built on exclusive reverence for Allah.
- By addressing them as “Children of Israel,” Allah appeals to their nobility, urging them to act in accordance with their ancestor Ya‘qūb’s عليه السلام pure faith.

**Āyah 41** — The covenant is detailed further about believing in the Qur’an and the Prophet ﷺ

# **Āyah 41**

وَآمِنُوا بِمَآ أَنزَلْتُ مُصَدِّقٗا لِّمَا مَعَكُمْ وَلَا تَكُونُوٓا أَوَّلَ كَافِرِۭ بِهِۦۖ وَلَا تَشْتَرُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِي ثَمَنٗا قَلِيلٗا وَإِيَّٰيَ فَٱتَّقُونِ

*And believe in what I have sent down, confirming what is with you, and do not be the first to disbelieve in it. And do not sell My ayaat for a small price, and Me alone – so be conscious of Me.*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

* **وَآمِنُوا** (*And believe*) – Command form directed at the People of the Book. Belief here means full acceptance, not selective affirmation.

* **بِمَآ أَنزَلْتُ** (*in what I have sent down*) – Referring to the Qur’an, emphasizing *direct divine origin* (“I have sent down”) to show its authority.

* **مُصَدِّقٗا لِّمَا مَعَكُمْ** (*confirming what is with you*) – The Qur’an is not alien to their scriptures but a *verifier* of their truth. This reduces excuses for denial since it aligns with what they already possess.

* **وَلَا تَكُونُوٓا أَوَّلَ كَافِرِۭ بِهِۦ** (*do not be the first to disbelieve in it*) – A powerful rebuke. They, being recipients of earlier revelation, should have been the *first believers*. Instead, Allah warns them not to disgrace themselves by leading in rejection. 
* ✦ The wording “first” carries irony and shame.

* **وَلَا تَشْتَرُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِي ثَمَنٗا قَلِيلٗا** (*And do not sell My ayaat for a small price*) –
  * *تَشْتَرُوا* = literally “purchase,” but used here for *bartering away truth for worldly gain*.
  * *ثَمَنٗا قَلِيلٗا* = “a petty price” – no matter how much wealth or power is gained, compared to divine truth it is trivial. 
  * ✦ The Qur’an belittles worldly gain by reducing it to *قليل* (small, insignificant).

* **وَإِيَّٰيَ فَٱتَّقُونِ** (*and Me alone, so be conscious of Me*) –
  * Strong exclusivity through fronting **إِيَّايَ** (Me alone) before the verb.
  * The Ayah closes with **taqwā**, the very essence of faith, reminding them that guidance is not about profit or power, but about fearing Allah alone.

**✦ Reflections**
* The Ayah strikes at three core diseases of the Banī Isrā’īl at the time of the beloved Prophet Muhammad ﷺ: arrogance in rejecting the Qur’an, greed for worldly gain, and misplaced fear of people over Allah.
* The style is deeply rhetorical: alternating between *commands* (believe, fear Me) and *prohibitions* (do not disbelieve, do not sell My āyāt). This rhythm mirrors the urgency and seriousness of the call.
* The exclusive phrasing **“Me alone”** reminds that the true currency is divine approval, not material benefit.

**Āyah 42** — The next step in this direct rebuke

# **Āyah 42**

وَلَا تَلْبِسُوا ٱلْحَقَّ بِٱلْبَـٰطِلِ وَتَكْتُمُوا ٱلْحَقَّ وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ

*“And do not mix the truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth while you know.”*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

* **وَلَا تَلْبِسُوا (Do not mix/confuse):**
  The verb *talbisū* comes from **labasa** (to cover, to obscure, to mix). It carries the image of clothing one thing with another so it appears disguised. Allah ﷻ uses it here to condemn how they **covered truth with falsehood**—a deliberate distortion, not an innocent mistake.
  ✦ Emotionally, it conveys *fraudulence*—a truth made unrecognizable by deceptive wrapping.

* **ٱلْحَقَّ (the Truth):**
  Definite article (al-) gives universality: the recognized, established truth—here referring to Allah’s revelation, the Torah and Qur’an alike.

* **بِٱلْبَـٰطِلِ (with falsehood):**
  *Bāṭil* is not merely “wrong,” but *that which is null, baseless, bound to perish.* The pairing *ḥaqq vs. bāṭil* is a Qur’anic rhetorical hallmark, creating sharp contrast between enduring truth and fading lies.

* **وَتَكْتُمُوا ٱلْحَقَّ (and do not conceal the truth):**
  *K-t-m* means to suppress, choke, smother. It paints the act of knowingly **burying revelation** to prevent people from recognizing the Qur’an’s confirmation of their scripture.

* **وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ (while you know):**
  The strongest rebuke—this is not ignorance, but conscious distortion. Knowledge increases responsibility. The Qur’an often intensifies blame when corruption is done *‘alā ‘ilm* (upon knowledge).

**✦ Reflections**
- The āyah exposes two levels of corruption:
	1. **Mixing truth with falsehood** — active distortion, making falsehood look legitimate.
	2. **Concealing truth** — passive betrayal, hiding what they know is right.
- Notice the progression: first “do not *mix*,” then “do not *hide*.” Mixing is corruption of clarity; hiding is removal of clarity altogether.
- The phrase *wa antum ta‘lamūn* cuts to the heart—it was not weakness, but arrogance and envy that led them to cover the truth of the beloved Prophet Muhammad ﷺ despite recognizing his signs in their own scripture.

#### Lets see how **Āyah 42 ties back** to the earlier divine method of da‘wah (reminder → warning → exposure of corruption)?
##### **The Da‘wah Method in Context**
1. **Reminder (تذكير)**
   Earlier āyāt reminded Banī Isrā’īl of Allah’s favors (e.g., *اذْكُرُوا نِعْمَتِيَ ٱلَّتِي أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ* – 2:40). This is soft entry: recalling blessings to awaken gratitude and obedience.

2. **Warning (إنذار)**
   Then Allah ﷻ warned them of accountability and of breaking their covenant: *وَأَوْفُوا بِعَهْدِي أُوفِ بِعَهْدِكُمْ* (2:40). The tone becomes more serious—covenants must not be betrayed.

3. **Exposure of Corruption (فضح الفساد)**
   Now, in **Āyah 42**, their actual crimes are laid bare:
   * **Mixing truth with falsehood** → intellectual dishonesty, misleading others.
   * **Concealing truth knowingly** → moral betrayal, hiding what should be declared.
##### **How Āyah 42 guides this sequence**
* **The progression is deliberate:**
	* First Allah appeals to their memory (reminder).
	* Then He warns them (warning).
	* When gentle methods are ignored, the Qur’an unmasks their corruption directly (exposure).
* **Why this method?**
  Human hearts vary: some respond to gratitude, some only to fear, and some require the shock of exposure. The divine da‘wah addresses all layers, leaving no excuse.

✦ The gentleness of *reminder* gave space for repentance.
✦ The sternness of *warning* pressed urgency.
✦ The sharpness of *exposure* removed their masks, showing that resistance to the beloved Prophet Muhammad ﷺ was not ignorance but **deliberate distortion “while you know.”**

**Āyah 43** — The next command, shifting from belief to action

# **Āyah 43**

وَأَقِيمُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَءَاتُوا۟ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ وَٱرْكَعُوا۟ مَعَ ٱلرَّٰكِعِينَ

*“And establish the prayer, and give the zakāh, and bow with those who bow.”*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

* **وَأَقِيمُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ (And establish the prayer):**
  * Verb *aqīmū* comes from *qāma* (to stand, uphold). *Iqāmah* implies more than “perform”—it means to **sustain prayer in its full reality**, with discipline, humility, and constancy.
  * Prayer here refers not only to ritual form but to its role as the central axis of worship and obedience.

* **وَءَاتُوا۟ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ (and give the zakāh):**
  * *Ātū* (give, deliver) indicates an **obligatory transfer** of right, not charity by choice.
  * *Zakāh* (purification, growth) conveys two layers: purifying wealth and purifying the soul from greed.
  * Addressing Banī Isrā’īl: they had their own obligations of almsgiving, yet they neglected its true spirit.

* **وَٱرْكَعُوا۟ مَعَ ٱلرَّٰكِعِينَ (and bow with those who bow):**
  * The striking phrasing—*with those who bow*—is an explicit command to join the community of believers in collective worship.
  * *Rukū‘* (bowing) is chosen over *ṣalāh* again because it marks the physical posture unique to the Muslim prayer, unlike Jewish prayer forms.
  * This is a subtle but powerful **invitation to join the ummah** of the beloved Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, not to remain isolated in arrogance.

**✦ Reflections**
- The Ayah shifts from *negative commands* (do not corrupt, do not conceal) to *positive obligations*—establish prayer, give zakāh, join the worshippers. It shows that truth is not just about belief, but must manifest in disciplined action.
- The progression is purposeful:
	1. **Ṣalāh** — the vertical bond with Allah ﷻ.
	2. **Zakāh** — the horizontal bond with people.
	3. **Congregational bowing** — merging into the body of believers, erasing elitism and division.
- The phrase *ma‘a al-rāki‘īn* is especially moving. It insists that worship is not to be done in isolation or pride, but in humble participation with the community—an answer to the Jews who claimed spiritual superiority and avoided praying behind the Muslims.

**Āyah 44** — The rebuke deepens (“do you order people to righteousness while forgetting yourselves?”)

# **Āyah 44**

أَتَأْمُرُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ بِٱلْبِرِّ وَتَنسَوْنَ أَنفُسَكُمْ وَأَنتُمْ تَتْلُونَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ ۚ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ

*“Do you command people to righteousness, yet forget yourselves, while you recite the Book? Will you not then use reason?”*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

* **أَتَأْمُرُونَ (Do you command):**
  * Interrogative *a-* at the beginning adds a tone of astonishment and rebuke.
  * *Ta’murūna* (you command) shows their outward image of authority, presenting themselves as moral guides.

* **ٱلنَّاسَ (the people):**
  * General term, not restricted to Jews or Muslims. Indicates their tendency to show off righteousness publicly before “all people.”

* **بِٱلْبِرِّ (to righteousness):**
  * *Birr* is comprehensive: all forms of goodness—faith, justice, compassion, obedience.
  * By using *al-birr* (with the definite article), Allah ﷻ highlights the **lofty, absolute goodness** they preached but did not embody.

* **وَتَنسَوْنَ أَنفُسَكُمْ (yet forget yourselves):**
  * *Tansawna* (to forget) here means “to neglect, abandon.”
  * Their hypocrisy is exposed: they were eager to guide others but ignored their own moral corruption.

* **وَأَنتُمْ تَتْلُونَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ (while you recite the Book):**
  * The rebuke intensifies: not only did they neglect themselves, but they did so **while having direct access to divine scripture**.
  * *Tatlūna* (recite) implies both reading aloud and continuous study—meaning their failure was not from ignorance, but from arrogance.

* **أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ (Will you not then use reason?):**
  * The Ayah ends with a question of intellect, not ritual.
  * Hypocrisy is portrayed as **irrational and self-contradictory**. If you know the truth and even call others to it, but fail to act, you contradict reason itself.

**✦ Reflections**
- The āyah exposes a timeless disease: hypocrisy of scholars and leaders who speak virtue but fail to live it. The Qur’an here shows that **knowledge without practice is irrational** and self-defeating.
- There is a sharp **contrast in tone** between this āyah and the previous one:
	- Āyah 43 was positive (pray, give zakāh, join worshippers).
	- Āyah 44 turns sharply into moral exposure—showing that real obedience cannot coexist with double standards.
- The choice of *birr* (a vast word) emphasizes that the issue was not small rituals but **the very essence of goodness**. They spoke of grand virtues while failing the most basic duties.
- Ending with *a-fa-lā ta‘qilūn* (“will you not reason?”) is deliberate: it shifts the criticism from just being a moral failure to being an **intellectual disgrace**. It implies: *Even a sound mind would not accept this contradiction.*

---

**Āyah 45** — Allah ﷻ gives the *remedy* for this hypocrisy—seeking help through ṣabr (patience) and ṣalāh

# **Āyah 45**

وَاسْتَعِينُوا بِالصَّبْرِ وَالصَّلَاةِ ۚ وَإِنَّهَا لَكَبِيرَةٌ إِلَّا عَلَى الْخَاشِعِينَ

*And seek help through patience and prayer. And indeed, it is surely difficult, except for the humble (those who are submissive to Allah).*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

* **وَاسْتَعِينُوا** – *And seek help*
  * From the root **ʿawn (عون)** meaning *support, aid*. The form *استفعل* (*استعان*) indicates actively turning to something for support, not passive waiting. It implies dependence on Allah by means of tools He has provided.

* **بِالصَّبْرِ** – *with patience*
  * **Ṣabr** comes from **ṣ-b-r (ص ب ر)** which originally means *to restrain, to hold firmly*. In Qur’anic usage, it extends to self-control during hardship, perseverance in obedience, and restraint from sin.
    ✦ Here, ṣabr is not just passive waiting but active strength of will — the ability to hold oneself steady for Allah.

* **وَالصَّلَاةِ** – *and prayer*
  * Prayer is placed next to patience as the greatest source of divine help. Ṣabr restrains the inner self, while ṣalāh connects one directly to Allah — an inward and outward balance of discipline and devotion.
    ✦ The pairing shows that patience without prayer can turn into stubborn endurance, while prayer without patience may collapse quickly. Together, they complete spiritual strength.

* **وَإِنَّهَا لَكَبِيرَةٌ** – *and indeed, it is surely burdensome*
  * **Kabīrah (كبيرة)** means *heavy, weighty, hard to bear*. The pronoun *ها* can refer either to *ṣalāh* specifically (as many Mufassirīn prefer) or to the combination of both ṣabr and ṣalāh.
    ✦ The Qur’an acknowledges that prayer feels burdensome on the ego — not because it lacks beauty, but because the soul clouded by heedlessness resists it.

* **إِلَّا عَلَى الْخَاشِعِينَ** – *except upon those who are humble*
  * **Khāshiʿīn (خاشعين)** comes from **khu-sh-ʿ (خشع)**, meaning *to be low, submissive, softened, humbled*. In Qur’anic usage, it describes a heart that is broken before Allah’s majesty, fully attentive, empty of arrogance.
    ✦ The word conveys not just humility, but an inner stillness where the heart bows before Allah before the body does.

**✦ Reflections**
* This āyah provides the *formula of resilience*: when overwhelmed, one turns not to distraction or complaint, but to ṣabr and ṣalāh.
* The Qur’an recognizes the human struggle — prayer feels *kabīrah* (burdensome) to the distracted soul. But for the *khāshiʿīn*, prayer is ease itself, because their hearts are softened and ready.
* The āyah teaches that spiritual weight is felt not because of prayer itself, but because of the state of the heart approaching it.

# **Āyah 46**

**ٱلَّذِينَ يَظُنُّونَ أَنَّهُم مُّلَٰقُوا۟ رَبِّهِمْ وَأَنَّهُمْ إِلَيْهِ رَٰجِعُونَ**

*Those who are certain that they will meet their Lord, and that to Him they will return.*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections**

* **ٱلَّذِينَ (those who):**
  Refers back to the truly humble in ṣalāh from the previous Ayah (45). It defines their inner quality.

* **يَظُنُّونَ (they think/assume/believe):**
  * In Arabic, **ظنّ** can mean "to think, suppose" (weaker assumption) or "to be convinced, certain" (strong conviction).
  * Here, scholars explain it as **certainty**, not doubt, because when used about the Hereafter in Qur’an, it implies strong belief.
    ✦ This word choice captures the emotional state: a believer lives with an ever-present awareness of meeting Allah, never heedless.

* **أَنَّهُم مُّلَٰقُوا۟ رَبِّهِمْ (that they will meet their Lord):**=
  * **ملاقوا** is from **لقاء** (meeting, encountering face-to-face).
  * Indicates a **direct, undeniable encounter** with Allah — standing before Him for judgment.
  * Notice it says **“their Lord” (رَبِّهِمْ)** instead of "Allah" — this makes the meeting intimate and personal: the very One who nurtured and sustained them will hold them accountable.

* **وَأَنَّهُمْ إِلَيْهِ رَٰجِعُونَ (and that to Him they will return):**
  * **رَاجِعُونَ** (returning) comes from **رجع** (to go back, revert).
  * Emphasizes that their origin is from Allah and their final destination is back to Him.
  * It shows the **circle of existence**: from Allah → through life → back to Allah.
  * Rāzī highlights that this dual mention (meeting + returning) stresses both the **direct encounter** and the **ultimate accountability**.

**✦ Reflections**
- The use of **ظنّ** (thought/conviction) instead of **علم** (knowledge) adds humility: believers never feel arrogant about their faith but live in **a trembling awareness** of the Hereafter.
- The pairing of **meeting (ملاقوا)** and **returning (راجعون)** creates a **rhythmic closure**: life’s journey is not random but ends in a decisive encounter with the One who began it.
- By mentioning **“their Lord” (رَبِّهِمْ)** rather than “Allah,” the āyah instills both **hope** (meeting the One who cares for them) and **awe** (standing before the ultimate authority).
- This Ayah describes the quality of those who find prayer easy: they live with **certainty of the Hereafter**, convinced they will meet their nurturing Lord and return to Him for judgment. This consciousness fuels humility and perseverance in worship.

## Rukūʿ 5: Summary

##### 1. **Call to Banī Isrā’īl**
* The rukūʿ opens with:
  *“O Children of Israel! Remember My favor which I bestowed upon you, and fulfill My covenant so I will fulfill your covenant…”* (2:40).
* This direct address is powerful because Banī Isrā’īl had lived the longest history of divine favors—prophets, scriptures, victories, and provision.
* Allah commands them to *remember* (اذكروا) rather than *know*, because they already knew. What was missing was gratitude and obedience.
✦ Reflection: Allah is teaching us that memory of blessings should trigger responsibility, not pride.
##### 2. **Fear and Guidance**
* They are reminded to fear **only Allah** and not trade His guidance for worldly gain (2:41–42).
* The Qur’an criticizes their habit of concealing truth or twisting scripture to maintain social/religious authority.
✦ Reflection: Religious corruption often begins when divine truth is compromised for power, reputation, or wealth.
##### 3. **Hypocrisy in Preaching**
* In 2:44: *“Do you order people to righteousness while you forget yourselves…?”*
* The imagery is sharp—like a preacher carrying a torch for others while walking blind into darkness.
* The ending phrase *“Will you not reason?”* (أفلا تعقلون) appeals to their intellect. Truth and hypocrisy cannot coexist.
✦ Reflection: A timeless warning to scholars, leaders, and all believers: our actions must align with our words.
##### 4. **Patience and Prayer as Tools**
* The section ends by teaching them the remedy: *seek help through patience and prayer* (2:45).
* Yet Allah adds a piercing observation: *“Indeed, it is surely difficult, except for the humble (خشعين).”*
* **خشوع (humility, reverence)** is key: it’s not just outward prayer, but inward submission that makes worship easy.
✦ Reflection: The Qur’an acknowledges that prayer feels heavy if the heart is not softened by humility.
##### 5. **Balance of Warning and Hope**
* This rukūʿ alternates between **reminding** (اذكروا), **warning** (لا تشتروا بآياتي ثمناً قليلاً), and **guiding** (استعينوا بالصبر والصلاة).
* The rhetorical beauty lies in how Allah directly confronts Banī Isrā’īl’s spiritual diseases, yet leaves the door wide open for reform.

---
#### *So far we have studied:*
* ***Rukūʿ 1 → Āyāt 1–7** (qualities of believers, disbelievers, and hypocrites introduced).*
* ***Rukūʿ 2 → Āyāt 8–20** (in-depth on hypocrisy, their disease, parables).*
* ***Rukūʿ 3 → Āyāt 21–29** (invitation to mankind: worship Allah, Qur’an’s challenge, parables, creation).*
* ***Rukūʿ 4 → Āyāt 30–39** (story of Adam ﷺ, angels, and descent to earth).*
* ***Rukūʿ 5 → Āyāt 40–46** (Bani Israel reminded of Allah’s favors, covenant, and warned against selective belief and neglect of prayer).*
