**Rukūʿ 4 (Āyah 30 onward)** — the story of **Ādam عليه السلام and Khilāfah**

# **Āyah 30**

**وَإِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ إِنِّي جَاعِلٌ فِي الْأَرْضِ خَلِيفَةً ۖ قَالُوا أَتَجْعَلُ فِيهَا مَن يُفْسِدُ فِيهَا وَيَسْفِكُ الدِّمَاءَ وَنَحْنُ نُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدِكَ وَنُقَدِّسُ لَكَ ۖ قَالَ إِنِّي أَعْلَمُ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ**

*And when your Lord said to the angels: “Indeed, I am placing a successor on earth.” They said: “Will You place upon it one who will spread corruption and shed blood, while we glorify You with praise and sanctify You?” He said: “Indeed, I know what you do not know.”*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

**وَإِذْ**

* “And when” — recalls a decisive past moment, pulling the listener into the scene.

**قَالَ رَبُّكَ**

* “Your Lord said” — direct address to the beloved Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, honoring him by involving him in the grand cosmic moment.

**لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ**

* “To the angels” — Allah discloses His plan to His pure servants, showing transparency in divine will.

**إِنِّي جَاعِلٌ**

* *I am making/appointing* — “جاعل” is an **active participle**, suggesting something already decreed and certain.
* Not “سأجعل” (I will make in the future), but a firm, ongoing decision.

**فِي الْأَرْضِ خَلِيفَةً**

* **خليفة** → from خلف (to come after). Two layers of meaning:
  1. **Successor**: one generation succeeding another.
  2. **Deputy/vicegerent**: entrusted with carrying out Allah’s command on earth.
* The openness of the word allows both senses — mankind succeeds each other, but also acts as Allah’s trustee.

**قَالُوا أَتَجْعَلُ فِيهَا…**

* The angels ask with humility — not objecting, but seeking understanding.
* Their concern: past experience with jinn or potential corruption in creation.

**مَن يُفْسِدُ فِيهَا وَيَسْفِكُ الدِّمَاءَ**

* **يفسد** → spread corruption, ruin harmony.
* **يسفك الدماء** → “spills blood in streams,” a vivid word of uncontrolled killing.

**وَنَحْنُ نُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدِكَ وَنُقَدِّسُ لَكَ**

* Angels present themselves as already filling the role of worship and purity:
  * **نسبح بحمدك** → glorify You with praise.
  * **نقدس لك** → declare Your holiness, purify ourselves for You.

**قَالَ إِنِّي أَعْلَمُ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ**

* Allah’s decisive answer — there are hidden dimensions of man’s potential (knowledge, will, worship through trial) that angels cannot perceive.
* A declaration of divine wisdom beyond created comprehension.

**✦ Reflections**
* This āyah marks a **turning point**: the introduction of **man’s role on earth** as khalīfah.
* The angels highlight man’s destructive potential; Allah highlights man’s hidden nobility and capacity.
* The balance: human beings are capable of *فساد* (corruption) and *دماء* (bloodshed), but also of *تسبيح* and *تقديس* at a level more meaningful than angels — because it is through free will, struggle, and choice.
* This āyah plants the seed of the **epic story of Adam عليه السلام**, his knowledge, trial, and elevation — all flowing from Allah’s words: *“Indeed, I know what you do not know.”*

**Āyah 31** — Allah demonstrates Adam’s unique knowledge to the angels

# **Āyah 31**

وَعَلَّمَ آدَمَ الْأَسْمَاءَ كُلَّهَا ثُمَّ عَرَضَهُمْ عَلَى الْمَلَائِكَةِ فَقَالَ أَنْبِئُونِي بِأَسْمَاءِ هَٰؤُلَاءِ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ

*And He taught Adam the names of all things, then presented them to the angels and said: “Inform Me of the names of these if you are truthful.”*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

**وَعَلَّمَ آدَمَ الْأَسْمَاءَ كُلَّهَا**

* *He taught Adam the names of all things*
* **‘All things’** is emphatic — every object, concept, and entity within Allah’s creation that Adam could comprehend.
* Teaching language and names signifies **intellectual elevation and understanding**, a gift of reason unique to humans.

**ثُمَّ عَرَضَهُمْ عَلَى الْمَلَائِكَةِ**

* *Then He presented them to the angels*
* **‘Aradahum** → to display, to put in clear view, publicly demonstrate.
* The Qur’an emphasizes that **man’s potential was made visible even to angels**, showing divine wisdom and the significance of human knowledge.

**فَقَالَ أَنْبِئُونِي بِأَسْمَاءِ هَٰؤُلَاءِ**

* *He said: “Inform Me of the names of these”*
* Challenge posed to angels — a test of their knowledge versus Adam’s new knowledge.
* **Rhetorical effect:** highlights **human uniqueness**; even beings of pure creation cannot surpass man in this aspect.

**إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ**

* *If you are truthful*
* The divine challenge underscores **truth versus assertion**: angels could only admit their limitations, while man’s knowledge proves the wisdom behind Allah’s khalīfah decision.

 **✦ Reflections**
* This āyah **establishes human superiority in knowledge**.
* Knowledge here is not just factual — it’s the **capacity for reason, naming, categorizing, and moral responsibility**.
* The sequence is logical and dramatic:
  1. Allah bestows knowledge on Adam.
  2. Angels are shown the result.
  3. Angels’ limitation is exposed.
* ✦ Lesson: **Human dignity is tied to knowledge and conscious choice** — a recurring Qur’anic theme.

**Āyah 32** — The angels witness the limitation of their own knowledge and respond

# **Āyah 32**

قَالُوا سُبْحَانَكَ لَا عِلْمَ لَنَا إِلَّا مَا عَلَّمْتَنَا ۖ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَلِيمُ الْحَكِيمُ

*They said: “Exalted are You; we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Indeed, You are the Knowing, the Wise.”*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

**قَالُوا سُبْحَانَكَ**

* *They said: “Exalted are You”*
* **Subḥānaka** = glory be to You; a declaration of Allah’s perfection and transcendence.
* The angels acknowledge **divine wisdom beyond their grasp**.

**لَا عِلْمَ لَنَا إِلَّا مَا عَلَّمْتَنَا**

* *We have no knowledge except what You have taught us*
* **La ‘ilm lanā** — complete negation of independent knowledge.
* Demonstrates that even angels, created beings, are **dependent on Allah’s revelation and teaching**.
* Contrast with Adam: though newly created, man has **capacity for learning and reason**, highlighting human potential.

**إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَلِيمُ الْحَكِيمُ**

* *Indeed, You are the Knowing, the Wise*
* Two key attributes emphasized:
  * **‘Alīm** – all-knowing, comprehensive knowledge.
  * **Ḥakīm** – perfectly wise, just, and purposeful in all decrees.
* Rhetorical effect: the angels acknowledge **divine wisdom in appointing Adam as khalīfah** despite their concerns.

**✦ Reflections**
* This Ayah completes the **lesson of divine knowledge vs. created understanding**:
	* Angels possess obedience and purity but **limited scope of understanding**.
	* Adam, endowed with names/knowledge, symbolizes **human potential for reasoning, learning, and moral responsibility**.
* The interaction between Allah, angels, and Adam establishes the **foundation of human dignity and vicegerency (khalīfah)**.
✦ Subtle wisdom: recognition of Allah’s knowledge is **necessary before claiming authority or judgment** — a model of humility even for perfect beings like angels.

---

**Āyah 33** — Allah challenges the angels about the names themselves?

# **Āyah 33**

قَالَ يَا آدَمُ أَنْبِئْهُم بِأَسْمَائِهِمْ ۖ فَلَمَّا أَنْبَأَهُم بِأَسْمَائِهِمْ قَالَ أَلَمْ أَقُل لَّكُمْ إِنِّي أَعْلَمُ غَيْبَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَأَعْلَمُ مَا تُبْدُونَ وَمَا كُنتُمْ تَكْتُمُونَ

*He said: “O Adam, inform them of their names.” And when he informed them of their names, He said: “Did I not tell you that I know the unseen of the heavens and the earth, and I know what you reveal and what you conceal?”*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

**قَالَ يَا آدَمُ أَنْبِئْهُم بِأَسْمَائِهِمْ**

* *He said: “O Adam, inform them of their names”*
* Allah **commands Adam to actively demonstrate** his unique knowledge.
* Rhetorical effect: human knowledge is **practical and revealed through action**, not mere potential.

**فَلَمَّا أَنْبَأَهُم بِأَسْمَائِهِمْ**

* *And when he informed them of their names*
* The Qur’an emphasizes sequence: Adam **acted on the knowledge**, proving capability and wisdom.
* This mirrors the **moral principle**: knowledge is validated through practice.

**قَالَ أَلَمْ أَقُل لَّكُمْ**

* *He said: “Did I not tell you…”*
* Divine reproof, a gentle reminder of Allah’s prior statement in Ayah 30: *“Indeed, I know what you do not know.”*

**إِنِّي أَعْلَمُ غَيْبَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ**

* *I know the unseen of the heavens and the earth*
* **‘Ghayb’** = hidden knowledge, inaccessible to creation.
* Highlights the **limit of angels’ knowledge** vs. the scope of divine wisdom.

**وَأَعْلَمُ مَا تُبْدُونَ وَمَا كُنتُمْ تَكْتُمُونَ**

* *And I know what you reveal and what you conceal*
* God’s omniscience encompasses both **external actions** and **internal thoughts or intentions**.
* Rhetorical effect: emphasizes **complete divine knowledge**, leaving no ambiguity.

**✦ Reflections**
* This Ayah **closes the first episode of Adam’s elevation**:
	  1. Adam is taught knowledge.
	  2. He demonstrates it to angels.
	  3. Allah confirms His prior statement about unseen wisdom.
✦ Lesson: human dignity and vicegerency rely on **both divine guidance and personal exercise of knowledge**.
* The interaction also reinforces: **angels recognize limits, humans exercise potential under divine will**, setting a template for human responsibility.

**Āyah 34** — The narrative of Iblīs’s refusal and rebellion

# **Āyah 34**

وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ اسْجُدُوا لِآدَمَ فَسَجَدُوا إِلَّا إِبْلِيسَ أَبَى وَاسْتَكْبَرَ وَكَانَ مِنَ الْكَافِرِينَ

*And when We said to the angels, “Prostrate to Adam,” they prostrated, except Iblīs; he refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers.*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

**وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ**

* *And when We said to the angels* — recalling a pivotal event, framing the narrative with divine command.

**اسْجُدُوا لِآدَمَ**

* *Prostrate to Adam* — not worship, but **an act of respect and acknowledgment of Adam’s elevated status**.
* **Sujud** here is **symbolic obedience**, demonstrating submission to divine decree.

**فَسَجَدُوا**

* *They prostrated* — angels obey immediately, showing **perfection in obedience and humility**.

**إِلَّا إِبْلِيسَ**

* *Except Iblīs* — stark contrast, emphasizing **his rebellion** and setting up moral tension.

**أَبَى وَاسْتَكْبَرَ**

* *He refused and was arrogant* —
  * **Abā** = flat refusal, rejection of command.
  * **Istakbara** = arrogance, pride, inflated self-regard.
* The combination shows **both choice and inner attitude** leading to defiance.

**وَكَانَ مِنَ الْكَافِرِينَ**

* *And he became of the disbelievers* — establishes the **consequence of arrogance**: rejection of divine authority = disbelief.
* Rhetorical effect: introduces **Iblīs as the archetype of rebellion**, setting a contrast with Adam’s obedience and human potential.

**✦ Reflections**
* This Ayah begins the **Iblīs narrative** and illustrates the **moral and spiritual consequences of pride**.
* Contrast is central:
  * Angels → immediate, humble obedience.
  * Iblīs → pride, refusal, disbelief.
  * Adam → knowledge + readiness to obey.
* ✦ Lesson: **obedience to divine will is tied to humility, not status or capability**.
* Iblīs’s refusal frames the ongoing Qur’anic theme of **human choice, trial, and accountability**.

#### Who is Iblīs?
* **Not an angel** — Qur’an clarifies elsewhere:
  * *“He was from the jinn, and he disobeyed the command of his Lord.”* (al-Kahf 18:50)
* Angels are by nature obedient (*lā yaʿṣūna Allāha mā amarahum* – 66:6), while **jinn have free will** like humans.
* He was, however, **among the angels** in rank and worship before his fall — hence he is addressed together with them.

#### Why did Iblīs refuse?
Qur’an shows his reasoning in multiple places:
1. **Pride in his origin (fire vs. clay):**
   * *“I am better than him. You created me from fire, and You created him from clay.”* (Ṣād 38:76, al-Aʿrāf 7:12)
     → He measured worth by substance, not obedience.

2. **Arrogance over status:**
   * He thought his long worship gave him superiority, but forgot that true rank is in **submission to Allah’s command**, not personal merit.

3. **Rebellion became disbelief:**
   * Refusal wasn’t just disobedience — it was a **denial of Allah’s wisdom and authority**.
   * Qur’an’s phrase *“wa kāna mina’l-kāfirīn”* shows he **entered into disbelief by choice**.
##### Rhetorical Nuances of “Iblīs”
* **Name “Iblīs”** likely comes from *balasa* = “to despair, to be cut off from hope.”
  * Hence, Iblīs = *the one cut off from mercy and hope*.
* Qur’an consistently contrasts his **arrogance** with Adam’s **humility**.

#### Role of Iblīs after the Fall
1. **Declared enmity to mankind:**
   * *“Because You have put me in error, I will surely sit in wait for them on Your straight path…”* (al-Aʿrāf 7:16–17)
   * His mission: to mislead humans through deception, whispers, and false promises.

2. **Limited power:**
   * He cannot force humans — only whisper and tempt.
   * *“Indeed, My servants — you have no authority over them…”* (al-Ḥijr 15:42).

3. **His ultimate end:**
   * He and his followers are destined for Hell.
   * His pride became the root of his eternal loss.
#### Lessons
* The **first sin** in creation’s story is **arrogance against Allah’s command**.
* Worship without humility can lead to ruin — Iblīs worshipped for ages, but pride nullified it.
* He becomes the **eternal example of misplaced logic**: he argued “fire is superior to clay,” but the command was from Allah, not about material essence.

#### Al-Rāzī on Iblīs’s Worship and Fall

##### 1. **Iblīs was not an angel**
* Rāzī stresses Qur’an 18:50: *“He was from the jinn.”*
* Angels are **maʿṣūm** (infallible) and cannot disobey, so Iblīs cannot be counted among them.
* He was among the **jinn who worshipped intensely**, and his devotion elevated him to ranks **where he stood with the angels**.

##### 2. **Iblīs’s long worship**
* Rāzī cites reports that Iblīs worshipped Allah in the heavens for **thousands of years** before Adam’s creation.
* Some narrations (not all authentic) say:
  * He was called *Ṭāwūs al-Malāʾikah* (the peacock of the angels) because of his worship.
* Yet, this **long worship was shattered by one moment of arrogance**.

##### 3. **Why did he refuse the command?**
Rāzī explores several **rational explanations** that Iblīs gave himself:
1. **Argument of origin:**
   * *“I am from fire, Adam is from clay — and fire is superior to clay.”*
   * Rāzī rebuts this: superiority is **not about material**, but about **obedience to Allah**.
   * Fire may rise, but clay bears life, growth, and stability — so the comparison was flawed.

2. **Pride in worship:**
   * Iblīs thought: *“I worshipped for ages — Adam is newly created — how can I bow to him?”*
   * Rāzī says: worship without humility leads only to self-destruction.

3. **Doubt in the wisdom of Allah’s command:**
   * By refusing, Iblīs effectively accused Allah’s order of being without wisdom — this is the very **essence of kufr**.
   
##### 4. **Was his sin kufr or just disobedience?**
* Rāzī analyzes the phrase *“wa kāna mina’l-kāfirīn”* (2:34):
  * He concludes that Iblīs **became a kāfir at that moment** because:
    * His refusal implied denial of Allah’s wisdom.
    * His arrogance was against Allah, not just against Adam.
* Thus, he was not just a disobedient servant — he became a **disbeliever**.

##### 5. **Psychological root of Iblīs’s downfall**
* Rāzī highlights **takabbur (arrogance)** as the root disease.
* Pride made him blind to the truth, even after ages of worship.
* He thought his logic (fire > clay) justified disobedience, but true intellect is in **submission to divine command**.

#### ✦ Rāzī’s Reflections / Lessons
1. **Worship is worthless without humility.**
   * A single moment of arrogance can erase a lifetime of devotion.
2. **True superiority is not material but spiritual.**
   * Fire vs. clay was irrelevant — the test was submission.
3. **Disobedience rooted in arrogance equals kufr.**
   * Because it challenges Allah’s authority and wisdom.
4. **The greatest danger to a believer is pride in his own deeds.**
   * This is why Iblīs’s story is told repeatedly — to warn us.

**Āyah 35** — Allah commands Adam and his spouse to inhabit Paradise.

# **Āyah 35**

وَقُلْنَا يَا آدَمُ اسْكُنْ أَنْتَ وَزَوْجُكَ الْجَنَّةَ وَكُلَا مِنْهَا رَغَدًا حَيْثُ شِئْتُمَا وَلَا تَقْرَبَا هَذِهِ الشَّجَرَةَ فَتَكُونَا مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ

*And We said: “O Adam, dwell, you and your spouse, in the Garden, and eat from it in abundance wherever you wish. But do not approach this tree, lest you become among the transgressors.”*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

**وَقُلْنَا يَا آدَمُ**

* Direct address highlights Adam’s honor and responsibility.
* “We said” emphasizes divine instruction, not mere suggestion.

**اسْكُنْ أَنْتَ وَزَوْجُكَ الْجَنَّةَ**

* *Reside, you and your spouse, in the Garden* — establishes both companionship (زوجك) and equality in trial.
* **Sukūn** = not just dwelling but *settled comfort and tranquility*.

**وَكُلَا مِنْهَا رَغَدًا**

* *And eat from it in abundance* — **Raghadan** = plentiful, easeful, unrestricted enjoyment.
* Emphasis: the Garden was a place of *comfort without hardship*.

**حَيْثُ شِئْتُمَا**

* *Wherever you wish* — unrestricted choice in all directions.
* Linguistic balance: freedom emphasized before restriction.

**وَلَا تَقْرَبَا هَذِهِ الشَّجَرَةَ**

* *But do not approach this tree* —
  * Not “do not eat” but **do not even approach**, a divine precaution against temptation.
  * **Hādhihi al-shajarah** — deixis (this tree) makes the prohibition vivid and direct.
* Rhetorical shift: After broad freedom, comes one precise restriction.

**فَتَكُونَا مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ**

* *Lest you be among the wrongdoers* —
  * Highlights accountability: wrong here = transgressing divine limits despite abundance elsewhere.

**✦ Reflections**
* The Ayah captures **the balance of divine generosity and divine restriction**: abundant freedom with one test of restraint.
* Human story begins with blessing → freedom → responsibility → prohibition. This mirrors our life’s moral test.
* The prohibition is not due to shortage but to establish **obedience over desire**.
* Linguistically, placing the **command to dwell and enjoy** before the **restriction** softens the trial and magnifies divine generosity.

**Āyah 36** — Iblīs deceives them and the first slip occurs

# **Āyah 36**

فَأَزَلَّهُمَا الشَّيْطَانُ عَنْهَا فَأَخْرَجَهُمَا مِمَّا كَانَا فِيهِ ۖ وَقُلْنَا اهْبِطُوا بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ ۖ وَلَكُمْ فِي الْأَرْضِ مُسْتَقَرٌّ وَمَتَاعٌ إِلَىٰ حِينٍ

*But Shayṭān caused them both to slip from it, and he expelled them from what they had been in. And We said: “Descend, \[all of you], as enemies to one another. And for you on the earth is a dwelling place and provision for a while.”*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

**فَأَزَلَّهُمَا الشَّيْطَانُ عَنْهَا**

* **Azallahumā** = caused them to slip → not an open rebellion but a subtle mistake, highlighting weakness of human will against deception.
* “Shayṭān” is introduced as the active deceiver, fulfilling his role as adversary.
* “ʿanhā” (from it) → from the station of the Garden, not just from the tree.

**فَأَخْرَجَهُمَا مِمَّا كَانَا فِيهِ**

* Expelled from their state of blessing, security, and ease.
* Phrase avoids naming *Jannah* again, increasing the sense of loss — a subtle rhetorical grief.

**وَقُلْنَا اهْبِطُوا**

* *Descend!* → command of removal, indicating a fall from higher to lower status.
* Sudden shift from second person (“eat, enjoy”) to plural imperative of descent — intensifies the seriousness.

**بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ**

* Enmity is not just Adam vs. Shayṭān, but also human vs. human, due to desires, ego, and trials.
* The singular “ʿaduww” (enemy) instead of plural adds weight, like a universal curse binding them all.

**وَلَكُمْ فِي الْأَرْضِ مُسْتَقَرٌّ وَمَتَاعٌ إِلَىٰ حِينٍ**

* **Mustaqarr** = a temporary settlement, not permanent. Earth is a place of trial, not final home.
* **Matāʿ** = provision, but with connotation of limited, perishable enjoyment.
* **Ilā ḥīn** = until an appointed time — earthly life is finite, preparing for resurrection.

**✦ Reflections**
* The Ayah captures the shift from **blissful nearness to Allah → descent into trial.**
* The slip is described with a gentle word (أزلّهما), reflecting Allah’s mercy in narrating human weakness.
* The introduction of enmity shows that the human story is one of conflict — both external (Shayṭān) and internal (selfishness, rivalry).
* The earth is not condemned; it is described as a place of sustenance — but *temporary*, reminding us that our true home is not here.

#### The word **أزلّهما** requires to pay more attention

##### 1. Choice of the Word **أزلّ**

Allah ﷻ could have used stronger verbs such as:

* **أضلّهما** (*led them astray*)
* **أغواهما** (*deceived them into misguidance*)
* **أفسدهما** (*corrupted them*)

But instead, He chose **أزلّهما** (*caused them to slip*).

This conveys:
* **A temporary lapse** — like a person slipping on a smooth surface. It does not mean a permanent fall.
* **Lack of intention for rebellion** — Adam عليه السلام and Hawwā’ were not stubbornly rejecting Allah’s command. They stumbled in weakness.
* **Ease of recovery** — a slip can be corrected; one gets up again. Thus, hope and mercy are embedded in the word.
✦ This shows divine compassion: Allah narrates their mistake in a soft way, not with harsh condemnation.
- **Contrast with Shayṭān**: His act was called **استكبر وكان من الكافرين** (*he arrogantly refused and became of the disbelievers*). The Qur’an uses strong, condemning language for him, but soft, merciful wording for Adam عليه السلام.
✦ This distinction shows the difference between a slip with humility and repentance, versus arrogance and pride.
##### 2. Morphology and Nuance
* Root: **ز ل ل** — refers to a foot slipping, a lapse after firmness.
* Form: **أزلّ** (causative) — Shayṭān *made them slip*, meaning he did not force them but whispered and enticed until they faltered.
✦ This protects human dignity: the fault is described as a slip, and the real aggressor is Shayṭān.

**Āyah 37** — Adam عليه السلام turns back in repentance and receives words from Allah

# **Āyah 37**

فَتَلَقَّىٰ آدَمُ مِن رَّبِّهِ كَلِمَاتٍ فَتَابَ عَلَيْهِ ۚ إِنَّهُ هُوَ التَّوَّابُ الرَّحِيمُ

*Then Adam received words from his Lord, so He accepted his repentance. Indeed, He is the One who continually turns in forgiveness, the Most Merciful.*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

**فَتَلَقَّىٰ آدَمُ**

* *Talqā* = to actively receive with eagerness, not just passively hear.
* Implies Adam عليه السلام was *awaiting, longing* for guidance on how to return to Allah.

**مِن رَّبِّهِ كَلِمَاتٍ**

* The words are not specified here — keeping them universal and timeless.
* Reported in other places (Sūrah al-Aʿrāf 23) as: *“Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves, and if You do not forgive us and have mercy on us, we will surely be among the losers.”*
* The phrase emphasizes that forgiveness requires *divine instruction* — we cannot repent without Allah teaching us how.

**فَتَابَ عَلَيْهِ**

* Allah “turned toward him” in mercy before Adam could fully turn toward Allah.
* It highlights that repentance is initiated by Allah’s grace, not by human merit alone.

**إِنَّهُ هُوَ التَّوَّابُ الرَّحِيمُ**

* **At-Tawwāb** = the One who continually accepts repentance, no matter how often. The form *faʿʿāl* shows repetition and intensity.
* **Ar-Raḥīm** = Merciful, emphasizing softness, tenderness, and ongoing care.
* Together, they show that divine mercy is not only about *pardoning* but also *nurturing after the fall.*

**✦ Reflections**
- This āyah is full of hope: even after disobedience, the door of return is open, *and Allah Himself teaches us the words to come back.*
- The structure moves from **fall (Āyah 36) → guidance (Āyah 37)**, showing that no slip is final if one turns back sincerely.
- The choice of the name “Adam” here (instead of “him”) personalizes the moment of mercy, highlighting Adam’s honored status despite his error.
- The emphasis on *kalimāt* shows that salvation lies in precise words taught by Allah, reflecting the Qur’an itself as ultimate guidance.

**Āyah 38** — Allah gives the universal message for Adam, his descendants, and the future generations

# **Āyah 38**

قُلْنَا اهْبِطُوا مِنْهَا جَمِيعًا ۖ فَإِمَّا يَأْتِيَنَّكُم مِّنِّي هُدًى فَمَن تَبِعَ هُدَايَ فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ

*We said: “Descend from it, all of you. Then, when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance — there shall be no fear upon them, nor shall they grieve.”*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

**قُلْنَا اهْبِطُوا**

* *Ihbiṭū* = descend, not merely “leave.” It implies a lowering of station, a move from honor to trial.
* Plural “you all” includes **Adam, Ḥawwā’, Iblīs, and all progeny**.

**مِنْهَا جَمِيعًا**

* *Jamīʿan* emphasizes **collective fate**: humanity shares the condition of earth-life with challenges, not just Adam alone.

**فَإِمَّا يَأْتِيَنَّكُم مِّنِّي هُدًى**

* *Hudā* = guidance, direction, light.
* The strong form *ya’tiyannakum* (with nūn of emphasis) assures certainty — guidance will definitely come.
* Allah’s mercy is seen: even after descent (a punishment), He immediately provides a way back.

**فَمَن تَبِعَ هُدَايَ**

* *Tabaʿa* = to follow closely, step by step — not just acknowledge.
* *Hudāya* (My guidance) = personalized — Allah attributes it to Himself, giving it supreme authority.

**فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ**

* A dual promise:
  * *No fear* = for the future (ākhirah).
  * *No grief* = over the past (dunyā).
* Together, it paints a picture of perfect inner peace.

**✦ Reflections**
- This āyah is **the covenant of guidance**: life on earth will be a test, but Allah will never leave humans without revelation.
- The rhythm moves from *fall (ihbiṭū)* → *hope (hudā)* → *safety (lā khawf…)*, showing that even descent is enveloped in mercy.
- The pairing of *fear* and *grief* addresses the two greatest human anxieties — the future and the past. Allah promises relief from both for those who follow His path.
- Unlike worldly laws, Allah’s guidance is described as *Hudāy* (My guidance) — personal, divine, beyond dispute.

**Āyah 39** — gives the contrast: the fate of those who reject this guidance

# **Āyah 39**

وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَكَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ أَصْحَـٰبُ ٱلنَّارِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَـٰلِدُونَ

*But those who disbelieve and deny Our signs — they are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein forever.*

## Lexical & Linguistic Insights with Reflections

**وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا**

* *Kafarū* = literally “covered.” They cover up the truth that is already clear.
* The use of the verb, not noun (*al-kāfirūn*), stresses the *act of rejecting* rather than a fixed label — it is a choice.

**وَكَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا**

* *Kadhdhabū* = to declare something a lie, not just disbelieve silently. It implies **active denial and opposition**.
* *Āyātinā* = “Our signs” — encompassing Qur’an, prophets, creation, miracles. Denial is not ignorance, but rejection of clear proof.

**أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ أَصْحَـٰبُ ٱلنَّارِ**

* *Ūlā’ika* = a distancing pronoun, rhetorically pushing them far away from Allah’s mercy.
* *Aṣḥāb al-nār* = “companions of the Fire.” The word *aṣḥāb* implies **close, inseparable association** — as if the Fire is their intimate companion.

**هُمْ فِيهَا خَـٰلِدُونَ**

* *Hum* = emphatic pronoun, exclusivity: they, and no one else.
* *Khālidūn* = abiding endlessly, never escaping.
* The permanence contrasts directly with the temporary test of dunya.

**✦ Reflections**
- The āyah forms a sharp **contrast** to the previous one (2:38). There, the promise was safety (*no fear, no grief*) for followers of guidance. Here, the result is eternal fire for rejecters.
- Notice the symmetry:
	- *Man tabiʿa hudāya* → no fear, no grief.
	- *Wa-lladhīna kafarū wa-kadhdhabū* → Fire, forever.
- The choice is made clear: descent to earth is not just punishment — it is the ground of free will, where every soul chooses either **companionship with Allah’s guidance** or **companionship with the Fire**.
- The use of *aṣḥāb* for Hell is striking: it suggests they belong there, as if it is their own circle, unlike the believers who belong to the company of Allah’s mercy.

## Rukūʿ 4: Summary
This rukūʿ is one of the most foundational passages in the Qur’an — it narrates the story of **Ādam عليه السلام**, the first human and prophet, and sets the stage for mankind’s journey on earth.
#### **Key Themes:**
1. **Appointment of the Khalīfah (Āyah 30)**
   * Allah ﷻ announces to the angels that He is placing a **vicegerent (khalīfah)** on earth.
   * The angels question — not out of disobedience, but seeking wisdom: *“Will You place in it one who will spread corruption and shed blood, while we glorify You?”*
   * Allah ﷻ responds with His absolute knowledge: *“I know what you do not know.”*
   ✦ Message: Human beings have a unique potential — not only to cause harm, but also to rise above the angels through knowledge, free will, and guidance.

2. **Teaching of Names (Āyah 31–33)**
   * Allah ﷻ teaches Ādam عليه السلام the **names of all things**, symbolizing knowledge, language, categorization, and understanding.
   * When the angels could not name them, and Ādam عليه السلام did, Allah ﷻ showed the superiority of human potential.
   * This scene establishes **‘ilm (knowledge)** as the foundation of humanity’s honor.
   ✦ Message: Man’s dignity is tied to knowledge and learning — not lineage, wealth, or force.

3. **The Prostration of Angels & Refusal of Iblīs (Āyah 34)**
   * All angels prostrate to Ādam عليه السلام (out of respect to Allah’s command, not worship of Ādam).
   * Iblīs refuses out of arrogance and envy, thus becoming a kāfir.
   * This marks the beginning of the enmity between mankind and Shayṭān.
   ✦ Message: Pride and envy are the root of Iblīs’s downfall — the greatest dangers to humans too.

3. **The Garden Trial (Āyah 35–36)**
   * Ādam عليه السلام and his wife are placed in Paradise with freedom, except for one prohibition: not to approach a specific tree.
   * Shayṭān whispers, leading them to slip.
   * They are sent down to earth, with enmity placed between mankind and Shayṭān.
   ✦ Message: Earth is not a fall from grace, but the intended arena of human trial. Shayṭān’s mission is declared — to mislead man.

3. **Repentance and Mercy (Āyah 37)**
   * Ādam عليه السلام receives **words of repentance** from Allah ﷻ.
   * Allah accepts his repentance, showing His mercy and forgiveness.
   ✦ Message: Unlike Iblīs, who blamed and persisted, Ādam acknowledged his mistake and returned to Allah. This difference defines guidance vs. misguidance.

3. **Covenant of Guidance (Āyah 38–39)**
   * Allah ﷻ declares: whenever guidance comes, whoever follows it will have **no fear, no grief**
   * Whoever rejects it will be **companions of the Fire, abiding therein forever**.
   ✦ Message: This sets the eternal law: human life is a test, the Qur’an is guidance, and the outcome is either eternal safety or eternal punishment.

### **Overall Reflection of Rukūʿ 4**
* Human beings are not angels — we have flaws and desires. But we also carry unique potential for knowledge, repentance, and closeness to Allah.
* Shayṭān’s rebellion sets the backdrop of our lives: a constant struggle against arrogance, envy, and whispering.
* Earth is not merely punishment; it is **the stage of honor and test**, where humans can rise above angels by choosing guidance.
* The beginning of humanity is a story of **hope and mercy**: despite error, Allah’s door of tawbah (repentance) remains open.
✦ This rukūʿ is the **blueprint of human existence**: who we are, why we are here, our enemy, our purpose, and our destiny.

## **🕋 Divine Thread**

30. *And when your Lord said to the angels: “Indeed, I am placing a successor on earth.” They said: “Will You place upon it one who will spread corruption and shed blood, while we glorify You with praise and sanctify You?” He said: “Indeed, I know what you do not know.”*
31. *And He taught Adam the names of all things, then presented them to the angels and said: “Inform Me of the names of these if you are truthful.”*
32. *They said: “Exalted are You; we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Indeed, You are the Knowing, the Wise.”*
33. *He said: “O Adam, inform them of their names.” And when he informed them of their names, He said: “Did I not tell you that I know the unseen of the heavens and the earth, and I know what you reveal and what you conceal?”*
34. *And when We said to the angels, “Prostrate to Adam,” they prostrated, except Iblīs; he refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers.*
35. *And We said: “O Adam, dwell, you and your spouse, in the Garden, and eat from it in abundance wherever you wish. But do not approach this tree, lest you become among the transgressors.”*
36. *But Shayṭān caused them both to slip from it, and he expelled them from what they had been in. And We said: “Descend, \[all of you], as enemies to one another. And for you on the earth is a dwelling place and provision for a while.”*
37. *Then Adam received words from his Lord, so He accepted his repentance. Indeed, He is the One who continually turns in forgiveness, the Most Merciful.*
38. *We said: “Descend from it, all of you. Then, when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance — there shall be no fear upon them, nor shall they grieve.”*
39. *But those who disbelieve and deny Our signs — they are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein forever.*
